<h2><a name="introduction">Preface</a></h2>

<p>Mr. Coleridge by his will, dated in September, 1829,
authorized his executor, if he should think it expedient, to
publish any of the notes or writing made by him (Mr. C.) in his
books, or any other of his manuscripts or writings, or any
letters which should thereafter be collected from, or supplied
by, his friends or correspondents. Agreeably to this authority,
an arrangement was made, under the superintendence of Mr. Green,
for the collection of Coleridge's literary remains; and at the
same time the preparation for the press of such part of the
materials as should consist of criticism and general literature,
was entrusted to the care of the present Editor. The volumes now
offered to the public are the first results of that arrangement.
They must in any case stand in need of much indulgence from the
ingenuous reader;- <i>multa sunt condonanda in opere postumo</i>;
but a short statement of the difficulties attending the
compilation may serve to explain some apparent anomalies, and to
preclude some unnecessary censure.<br>
<br>
The materials were fragmentary in the extreme &shy; Sibylline
leaves; &shy; notes of the lecturer, memoranda of the
investigator, out-pourings of the solitary and self-communing
student. The fear of the press was not in them. Numerous as they
were, too, they came to light, or were communicated, at different
times, before and after the printing was commenced; and the
dates, the occasions, and the references, in most instances
remained to be discovered or conjectured. To give to such
materials method and continuity, as far as might be, &shy; to set
them forth in the least disadvantageous manner which the
circumstances would permit, &shy; was a delicate and perplexing
task; and the Editor is painfully sensible that he could bring
few qualifications for the undertaking, but such as were involved
in a many years' intercourse with the author himself, a patient
study of his writings, a reverential admiration of his genius,
and an affectionate desire to help in extending its beneficial
influence.<br>
<br>
The contents of these volumes are drawn from a portion only of
the manuscripts entrusted to the Editor: the remainder of the
collection, which, under favourable circumstances, he hopes may
hereafter see the light, is at least of equal value with what is
now presented to the reader as a sample. In perusing the
following pages, the reader will, in a few instances, meet with
disquisitions of a transcendental character, which, as a general
rule, have been avoided: the truth is, that they were sometimes
found so indissolubly intertwined with the more popular matter
which preceded and followed, as to make separation impracticable.
There are very many to whom no apology will be necessary in this
respect; and the Editor only adverts to it for the purpose of
obviating, as far as may be, the possible complaint of the more
general reader. But there is another point to which, taught by
past experience, he attaches more importance, and as to which,
therefore, he ventures to put in a more express and particular
caution. In many of the books and papers, which have been used in
the compilation of these volumes, passages from other writers,
noted down by Mr. Coleridge as in some way remarkable, were mixed
up with his own comments on such passages, or with his
reflections on other subjects, in a manner very embarrassing to
the eye of a third person undertaking to select the original
matter, after the lapse of several years. The Editor need not say
that he has not knowingly admitted any thing that was not genuine
without an express declaration, as in Vol. I. p. 1; and in
another instance, Vol. II. p. 379, he has intimated his own
suspicion: but, besides these, it is possible that some cases of
mistake in this respect may have occurred. There may be one or
two passages &shy; they cannot well be more &shy; printed in
these volumes, which belong to other writers; and if such there
be, the Editor can only plead in excuse, that the work has been
prepared by him amidst many distractions, and hope that, in this
instance at least, no ungenerous use will be made of such a
circumstance to the disadvantage of the author, and that persons
of greater reading or more retentive memories than the Editor,
who may discover any such passages, will do him the favour to
communicate the fact.<br>
<br>
The Editor's motive in publishing the few poems and fragments
included in these volumes, was to make a supplement to the
collected edition of Coleridge's poetical works. In these
fragments the reader will see the germs of several passages in
the already published poems of the author, but which the Editor
has not thought it necessary to notice more particularly. <i>The
Fall of Robespierre</i>, a joint composition, has been so long in
print in the French edition of Coleridge's poems, that,
independently of such merit as it may possess, it seemed natural
to adopt it upon the present occasion, and to declare the true
state of the authorship.<br>
<br>
To those who have been kind enough to communicate books and
manuscripts for the purpose of the present publication, the
Editor and, through him, Mr. Coleridge's executor return their
grateful thanks. In most cases a specific acknowledgement has
been made. But, above and independently of all others, it is to
Mr. and Mrs. Gillman, and to Mr. Green himself, that the public
are indebted for the preservation and use of the principal part
of the contents of these volumes. The claims of those respected
individuals on the gratitude of the friends and admirers of
Coleridge and his works are already well known, and in due season
those claims will receive additional confirmation.<br>
<br>
With these remarks, sincerely conscious of his own inadequate
execution of the task assigned to him, yet confident withal of
the general worth of the contents of the following pages &shy;
the Editor commits the reliques of a great man to the indulgent
consideration of the Public.<br>

<blockquote><i>L'Envoy.</i><br>
<br>
He was one who with long and large arm still collected precious
armfulls in whatever direction he pressed forward, yet still took
up so much more than he could keep together, that those who
followed him gleaned more from his continual droppings than he
himself brought home; &shy; nay, made stately corn-ricks
therewith, while the reaper himself was still seen only with a
strutting armful of newly-cut sheaves. But I should misinform you
grossly if I left you to infer that his collections were a heap
of incoherent <i>miscellanea</i>. No! the very contrary. Their
variety, conjoined with the too great coherency, the too great
both desire and power of referring them in systematic, nay,
genetic subordination, was that which rendered his schemes
gigantic and impracticable, as an author, and his conversation
less instructive as a man.<br>
<br>
<i>Auditorem inopem ipsa copia fecit</i>.<br>
<br>
&shy; Too much was given, all so weighty and brilliant as to
preclude a chance of its being all received, &shy; so that it not
seldom passed over the hearer's mind like a roar of many
waters.</blockquote>

<p><i>and other poems</i><br>
<br>
to H. Martin, Esq.<br>
of Jesus College, Cambridge<br>
<br>
Dear Sir<br>
Accept, as a small testimony of my grateful attachment, the
following Dramatic Poem, in which I have endeavoured to detail,
in an interesting form, the fall of a man, whose great bad
actions have cast a disastrous lustre on his name. In the
execution of the work, as intricacy of plot could not have been
attempted without a gross violation of recent facts, it has been
my sole aim to imitate the impassioned and highly figurative
language of the French Orators, and to develope the characters of
the chief actors on a vast stage of horrors.<br>
<br>
Yours fraternally,<br>
<br>

A friendly shelter, ere it bursts upon him.<br>
But where? and how? I fear the tyrant's soul &shy;<br>
Sudden in action, fertile in resource,<br>
And rising awful 'mid impending ruins;<br>
In splendour gloomy, as the midnight meteor,<br>
That fearless thwarts the elemental war.<br>
When last in secret conference we met,<br>
He scowl'd upon me with suspicious rage,<br>
Making his eye the inmate of my bosom.<br>
I know he scorns me &shy; and I feel, I hate him &shy;<br>
Yet there is in him that which makes me tremble!</blockquote>

<blockquote>It was Barrere, Legendre! didst thou mark him?<br>
Abrupt he turn'd, yet linger'd as he went,<br>
And tow'rds us cast a look of doubtful meaning.</blockquote>

<br>
 LEGENDRE.

<blockquote>I mark'd him well. I met his eye's last glance;<br>
It menac'd not so proudly as of yore.<br>
Methought he would have spoke &shy; but that he dar'd not
&shy;<br>
Such agitation darken'd on his brow.</blockquote>

 TALLIEN.

<blockquote>'Twas all-distrusting guilt that kept from
bursting<br>
Th' imprison'd secret struggling in the face:<br>
E'en as the sudden breeze upstarting onwards<br>
Hurries the thunder cloud, that pois'd awhile<br>
Hung in mid air, red with its mutinous burthen.</blockquote>

 LEGENDRE.

<blockquote>Perfidious traitor! &shy; still afraid to bask<br>
In the full blaze of power, the rustling serpent<br>
Lurks in the thicket of the tyrant's greatness,<br>
Ever prepar'd to sting who shelters him.<br>
Each thought, each action in himself converges;<br>
And love and friendship on his coward heart<br>
Shine like the powerless sun on polar ice:<br>
To all attach'd, by turns deserting all,<br>
Cunning and dark &shy; a necessary villain!</blockquote>

<br>
 TALLIEN.

<blockquote>Yet much depends upon him &shy; well you know<br>
With plausible harangue 'tis his to paint<br>
Defeat like victory &shy; and blind the mob<br>
With truth-mix'd falsehood. They, led on by him,<br>
And wild of head to work their own destruction,<br>
Support with uproar what he plans in darkness.</blockquote>

<br>
 LEGENDRE.

<blockquote>O what a precious name is liberty<br>
To scare or cheat the simple into slaves!<br>
Yes &shy; we must gain him over: by dark hints<br>
We'll show enough to rouse his watchful fears,<br>
Till the cold coward blaze a patriot.<br>
O Danton! murder'd friend! assist my counsels &shy;<br>

Leap'd the younger Robespierre; but his fractur'd limb<br>

He plann'd for thousands. Oh! my sickening heart<br>
Has sunk within me, when the various woes<br>

In ghastly numbers &shy; when assembled hordes,<br>
Dragg'd from their hovels by despotic power,<br>

To govern France; and Petion talk'd of virtue,<br>

Where the last Louis pour'd his guilty blood,<br>
Fell Brissot's head, the womb of darksome treasons,<br>
And Orleans, villain kinsman of the Capet,<br>
And Hebert's atheist crew, whose maddening hand<br>
Hurl'd down the altars of the living God,<br>
With all the infidel's intolerance.<br>
The last worst traitor triumph'd &shy; triumph'd long,<br>
Secured by matchless villany. By turns<br>
Defending and deserting each accomplice<br>
As interest prompted. In the goodly soil<br>
Of Freedom, the foul tree of treason struck<br>
Its deep-fix'd roots, and dropt the dews of death<br>
On all who slumber'd in its specious shade.<br>
He wove the web of treachery. He caught<br>
The listening crowd by his wild eloquence,<br>
His cool ferocity that persuaded murder,<br>
Even whilst it spake of mercy! &shy; never, never<br>
Shall this regenerated country wear<br>
The despot yoke. Though myriads round assail,<br>
And with worse fury urge this new crusade<br>
Than savages have known; though the leagued despots<br>
Depopulate all Europe, so to pour<br>
The accumulated mass upon our coasts,<br>
Sublime amid the storm shall France arise,<br>
And like the rock amid surrounding waves<br>
Repel the rushing ocean. &shy; She shall wield<br>
The thunder-bolt of vengeance &shy; she shall blast<br>
The despot's pride, and liberate the world!</blockquote>

 <a name="f1"></a><span style="color: #FF0000;">Footnote
1</span>: The origin and authorship of <i>The Fall of
Robespierre</i> will be best explained by the following extract
from a letter from Mr. Southey to the Editor:<br>
<br>
"This is the history of <i>The Fall of Robespierre</i>. It
originated in sportive conversation at poor Lovell's, and we
agreed each to produce an act by the next evening; &shy; S. T. C.
the first, I the second, and Lovell the third. S. T. C. brought
part of his, I and Lovell the whole of ours; but L.'s was not in
keeping, and therefore I undertook to supply the third also by
the following day. By that time, S. T. C. had filled up his. A
dedication to Mrs. Hannah More was concocted, and the notable
performance was offered for sale to a bookseller in Bristol, who
was too wise to buy it. Your Uncle took the MSS. with him to
Cambridge, and there rewrote the first act at leisure, and
published it. My portion I never saw from the time it was written
till the whole was before the world. It was written with
newspapers before me, as fast as newspaper could be put into
blank verse. I have no desire to claim it now, or hereafter; but
neither am I ashamed of it; and if you think proper to print the
whole, so be it." &shy; <br>
<br>
"<i>The Fall of Robespierre</i>, a tragedy, of which the first
act was written by S. T. Coleridge." Mr. C.'s note in the
<i>Conciones ad Populum</i>, 1795. (Ed.)<br>

Small poets loved to sing her blooming face.<br>
Before her altars, lo! a numerous train<br>
Preferr'd their vows; yet all preferr'd in vain:<br>

Tell! ye neglected sylphs! who lap-dogs guard,<br>
Why snatch'd ye not away your precious ward?<br>
Why suffer'd ye the lover's weight to fall<br>
On the ill-fated neck of much-loved Ball?<br>
The favourite on his mistress cast his eyes,<br>
Gives a short melancholy howl, and &shy; dies!<br>
Sacred his ashes lie, and long his rest!<br>
Anger and grief divide poor Julia's breast.<br>
Her eyes she fix'd on guilty Florio first,<br>
On him the storm of angry grief must burst.<br>
That storm he fled:&shy; he wooes a kinder fair,<br>
Whose fond affections no dear puppies share.<br>
'Twere vain to tell how Julia pined away; &shy;<br>
Unhappy fair, that in one luckless day<br>
(From future almanacks the day be crost!)<br>
At once her lover and her lap-dog lost!</blockquote>

<blockquote>Thus far my scanty brain hath built the rhyme<br>
Elaborate and swelling; &shy; yet the heart<br>
Not owns it. From thy spirit-breathing powers<br>
I ask not now, my friend! the aiding verse<br>
Tedious to thee, and from thy anxious thought<br>
Of dissonant mood. In fancy (well I know)<br>
From business wand'ring far and local cares,<br>
Thou creepest round a dear-loved sister's bed<br>
With noiseless step, and watchest the faint look,<br>
Soothing each pang with fond solicitude,<br>
And tenderest tones medicinal of love.<br>
<a name="f5r"></a>I, too, a sister had, an only sister &shy; <a

She loved me dearly, and I doted on her;<br>
To her I pour'd forth all my puny sorrows;<br>
(As a sick patient in a nurse's arms,)<br>
And of the heart those hidden maladies &shy;<br>
That e'en from friendship's eye will shrink ashamed.<br>
O! I have waked at midnight, and have wept<br>
Because she was not! &shy; Cheerily, dear Charles!<br>
Thou thy best friend shalt cherish many a year;<br>
Such warm presages feel I of high hope!<br>
For not uninterested the dear maid<br>
I've view'd &shy; her soul affectionate yet wise,<br>
Her polish'd wit as mild as lambent glories<br>
That play around a sainted infant's head.<br>

"I will add, at the risk of appearing to dwell too long on
religious topics, that on this my first introduction to
Coleridge, he reverted with strong compunction to a sentiment
which he had expressed in earlier days upon prayer. In one of his
youthful poems, speaking of God, he had said, &shy;

<blockquote>&shy; 'Of whose all-seeing eye<br>
 Aught to demand were impotence of mind.'</blockquote>

This sentiment he now so utterly condemned, that, on the
contrary, he told me, as his own peculiar opinion, that the act
of praying was the highest energy of which the human heart was
capable &shy; praying, that is, with the total concentration of
the faculties; and the great mass of worldly men and of learned
men he pronounced absolutely incapable of praying." (Mr. De
Quincey in <i>Tait's Magazine</i>, September, 1834, p.515.)<br>
"Mr. Coleridge, within two years of his death, very solemnly
declared to me his conviction upon the same subject. I was
sitting by his bed-side one afternoon, and he fell &shy; an
unusual thing for him &shy; into a long account of many passages
of his past life, lamenting some things, condemning others, but
complaining withal, though very gently, of the way in which many
of his most innocent acts had been cruelly misrepresented. 'But I
have no difficulty,' said he, 'in forgiveness; indeed, I know not
how to say with sincerity the clause in the Lord's Prayer, which
asks forgiveness <i>as we forgive</i>. I feel nothing answering
to it in my heart. Neither do I find, or reckon, the most solemn
faith in God as a real object, the most arduous act of the reason
and will; &shy; O no! my dear, it is <i>to pray</i>, to pray as
God would have us; this is what at times makes me turn cold to my
soul. Believe me, to pray with all your heart and strength, with
the reason and the will, to believe vividly that God will listen
to your voice through Christ, and verily do the thing he pleaseth
thereupon &shy; this is the last, the greatest achievement of the
Christian's warfare on earth. <i>Teach</i> us to pray, O Lord!'
And then he burst into a flood of tears, and begged me to pray
for him. O what a sight was there!" <i>Table Talk</i>, vol. i. p.

Wak'd by heaven's silent dews at eve's mild gleam,<br>

<h3><a name="section9">Casimir</a></h3>

<p><a name="f7r"></a>If we except Lucretius and Statius, I know
no Latin poet, ancient or modern, who has equalled Casimir in
boldness of conception, opulence of fancy, or beauty of
versification. The <i>Odes</i> of this illustrious Jesuit were
translated into English about 150 years ago, by a G. Hils, I
think. <a href="#f7">1</a><br>
I never saw the translation. A few of the <i>Odes</i> have been
translated in a very animated manner by Watts. I have subjoined
the third Ode of the second Book, which, with the exception of
the first line, is an effusion of exquisite elegance. In the
imitation attempted, I am sensible that I have destroyed the
effect of suddenness, by translating into two stanzas what is one
in the original. 1796.<br>

<h2><a name="section23">Introduction to the Tale of the Dark
Ladie</a></h2>

<p>The following poem is intended as the introduction to a
somewhat longer one. The use of the old ballad word <i>Ladie</i>
for Lady, is the only piece of obsoleteness in it; and as it is
professedly a tale of ancient times, I trust that the
affectionate lovers of venerable antiquity, as Camden says, will
grant me their pardon, and perhaps may be induced to admit a
force and propriety in it. A heavier objection may be adduced
against the author, that in these times of fear and expectation,
when novelties explode around us in all directions, he should
presume to offer to the public a silly tale of old-fashioned
love: and five years ago, I own I should have allowed and felt
the force of this objection. But alas! explosion has succeeded
explosion so rapidly, that novelty itself ceases to appear new;
and it is possible that now, even a simple story, wholly
uninspired with politics or personality, may find some attention
amid the hubbub of revolutions, as to those who have remained a

<h2><a name="section28">an Ode to the Rain</a></h2>

<p><i>composed before day-light on the morning appointed for the
departure of a very worthy, but not very pleasant visitor, whom
it was feared the rain might detain</i><br>
</p>

<blockquote>I know it is dark; and though I have lain<br>
Awake, as I guess, an hour or twain,<br>
I have not once open'd the lids of my eyes,<br>
But I lie in the dark, as a blind man lies.<br>
0 Rain! that I lie listening to,<br>
 You're but a doleful sound at best:<br>
I owe you little thanks, 'tis true,<br>
 For breaking thus my needful rest!<br>
Yet if, as soon as it is light,<br>
O Rain! you will but take your flight,<br>
I'll neither rail, nor malice keep,<br>
Though sick and sore for want of sleep.<br>
<br>
But only now, for this one day,<br>
Do go, dear Rain! do go away!<br>
O Rain! with your dull two-fold sound,<br>
The clash hard by, and the murmur all round!<br>
You know, if you know aught, that we,<br>
Both night and day, but ill agree:<br>
For days, and months, and almost years,<br>
Have limped on through this vale of tears,<br>
Since body of mine, and rainy weather,<br>
Have lived on easy terms together.<br>
Yet if, as soon as it is light,<br>
O Rain! you will but take your flight,<br>
Though you should come again to-morrow,<br>
And bring with you both pain and sorrow;<br>
Though stomach should sicken, and knees should swell &shy;<br>
I'll nothing speak of you but well.<br>
But only now for this one day,<br>
Do go, dear Rain! do go away!<br>
<br>
Dear Rain! I ne'er refused to say<br>
You're a good creature in your way.<br>
Nay, I could write a book myself,<br>
Would fit a parson's lower shelf,<br>
Showing, how very good you are. &shy;<br>
What then? sometimes it must be fair!<br>
And if sometimes, why not to-day?<br>
Do go, dear Rain! do go away!<br>
<br>
Dear Rain! if I've been cold and shy,<br>
Take no offence! I'll tell you why.<br>
A dear old Friend e'en now is here,<br>
And with him came my sister dear;<br>
After long absence now first met,<br>
Long months by pain and grief beset &shy;<br>
With three dear friends! in truth, we groan<br>
Impatiently to be alone.<br>
We three, you mark! and not one more!<br>
The strong wish makes my spirit sore.<br>
We have so much to talk about,<br>
So many sad things to let out;<br>
So many tears in our eye-corners,<br>
Sitting like little Jacky Horners &shy;<br>
In short, as soon as it is day,<br>
Do go, dear Rain! do go away.<br>
<br>
And this I'll swear to you, dear Rain!<br>
Whenever you shall come again,<br>
Be you as dull as e'er you could;<br>
(And by the bye 'tis understood,<br>
You're not so pleasant, as you're good;)<br>
Yet, knowing well your worth and place,<br>
I'll welcome you with cheerful face;<br>
And though you stay'd a week or more,<br>
Were ten times duller than before;<br>
Yet with kind heart, and right good will,<br>
I'll sit and listen to you still;<br>
Nor should you go away, dear Rain!<br>
Uninvited to remain.<br>

<h2><a name="section36">A Course of Lectures</a></h2>

<h3><a name="section37">Prospectus</a></h3>

<p>There are few families, at present, in the higher and middle
classes of English society, in which literary topics and the
productions of the Fine Arts, in some one or other of their
various forms, do not occasionally take their turn in
contributing to the entertainment of the social board, and the
amusement of the circle at the fire side. The acquisitions and
attainments of the intellect ought, indeed, to hold a very
inferior rank in our estimation, opposed to moral worth, or even
to professional and specific skill, prudence, and industry. But
why should they be opposed, when they may be made subservient
merely by being subordinated? It can rarely happen, that a man of
social disposition, altogether a stranger to subjects of taste,
(almost the only ones on which persons of both sexes can converse
with a common interest) should pass through the world without at
times feeling dissatisfied with himself. The best proof of this
is to be found in the marked anxiety which men, who have
succeeded in life without the aid of these accomplishments, shew
in securing them to their children. A young man of ingenuous mind
will not wilfully deprive himself of any species of respect. He
will wish to feel himself on a level with the average of the
society in which he lives, though he may be ambitious of
distinguishing himself only in his own immediate pursuit or
occupation.<br>
<br>
Under this conviction, the following <i>Course of Lectures</i>
was planned. The several titles will best explain the particular
subjects and purposes of each: but the main objects proposed, as
the result of all, are the two following.<br>
<br>
1. To convey, in a form best fitted to render them impressive at
the time, and remembered afterwards, rules and principles of
sound judgment, with a kind and degree of connected information,
such as the hearers cannot generally be supposed likely to form,
collect, and arrange for themselves, by their own unassisted
studies. It might be presumption to say, that any important part
of these Lectures could not be derived from books; but none, I
trust, in supposing, that the same information could not be so
surely or conveniently acquired from such books as are of
commonest occurrence, or with that quantity of time and attention
which can be reasonably expected, or even wisely desired, of men
engaged in business and the active duties of the world.<br>
<br>
2. Under a strong persuasion that little of real value is derived
by persons in general from a wide and various reading; but still
more deeply convinced as to the actual mischief of unconnected
and promiscuous reading, and that it is sure, in a greater or
less degree, to enervate even where it does not likewise inflate;
I hope to satisfy many an ingenuous mind, seriously interested in
its own development and cultivation, how moderate a number of
volumes, if only they be judiciously chosen, will suffice for the
attainment of every wise and desirable purpose; that is, in
addition to those which he studies for specific and professional
purposes. It is saying less than the truth to affirm, that an
excellent book (and the remark holds almost equally good of a
Raphael as of a Milton) is like a well chosen and well tended
fruit tree. Its fruits are not of one season only. With the due
and natural intervals, we may recur to it year after year, and it
will supply the same nourishment and the same gratification, if
only we ourselves return to it with the same healthful
appetite.<br>
<br>
The subjects of the Lectures are indeed very different, but not
(in the strict sense of the term) diverse; they are various,
rather than miscellaneous. There is this bond of connexion common
to them all, &shy; that the mental pleasure which they are
calculated to excite is not dependent on accidents of fashion,
place, or age, or the events or the customs of the day; but
commensurate with the good sense, taste, and feeling, to the
cultivation of which they themselves so largely contribute, as
being all in kind, though not all in the same degree, productions
of genius.<br>
<br>
What it would be arrogant to promise, I may yet be permitted to
hope, &shy; that the execution will prove correspondent and
adequate to the plan. Assuredly, my best efforts have not been
wanting so to select and prepare the materials, that, at the
conclusion of the Lectures, an attentive auditor, who should
consent to aid his future recollection by a few notes taken
either during each Lecture or soon after, would rarely feel
himself, for the time to come, excluded, from taking an
intelligent interest in any general conversation likely to occur
in mixed society.<br>
<br>
<b><i>Syllabus of the Course</i></b>.<br>
<br>
<b>I.</b> January 27, l8l8. &shy; On the manners, morals,
literature, philosophy, religion, and the state of society in
general, in European Christendom, from the eighth to the
fifteenth century, (that is from A.D. 700, to A.D. 1400), more
particularly in reference to England, France, Italy and Germany;
in other words, a portrait of the so called dark ages of
Europe.<br>
<br>
<b>II.</b> January 30. &shy; On the tales and metrical romances
common, for the most part, to England, Germany, and the north of
France, and on the English songs and ballads, continued to the
reign of Charles I. A few selections will be made from the
Swedish, Danish, and German languages, translated for the purpose
by the Lecturer.<br>
<br>
<b>III.</b> February 3. &shy; Chaucer and Spenser; of Petrarch;
of Ariosto, Pulci, and Boiardo.<br>
<br>
<b>IV. V. VI.</b> February 6, 10, l3. &shy; On the dramatic works
of Shakspeare. In these Lectures will be comprised the substance
of Mr. Coleridge's former courses on the same subject, enlarged
and varied by subsequent study and reflection.<br>
<i>Note: These lectures have not been included in the original
text. html</i> Ed.<br>
<br>
<b>VII.</b> February l7. &shy; On Ben Jonson, Beaumont and
Fletcher, and Massinger; with the probable causes of the
cessation of dramatic poetry in England with Shirley and Otway,
soon after the restoration of Charles II.<br>
<br>
<b>VIII.</b> February 20. &shy; Of the life and all the works of
Cervantes, but chiefly of his Don Quixote. The ridicule of knight
errantry shewn to have been but a secondary object in the mind of
the author, and not the principal cause of the delight which the
work continues to give to all nations, and under all the
revolutions of manners and opinions.<br>
<br>
<b>IX.</b> February 24. &shy; On Rabelais, Swift, and Sterne: on
the nature and constituents of genuine Humour, and on the
distinctions of the Humorous from the Witty, the Fanciful, the
Droll, and the Odd.<br>
<br>
<b>X.</b> February 27. &shy; Of Donne, Dante, and Milton.<br>
<br>
<b>XI.</b> March 3. &shy; On the Arabian Nights' Entertainments,
and on the romantic use of the supernatural in poetry, and in
works of fiction not poetical. On the conditions and regulations
under which such books may be employed advantageously in the
earlier periods of education.<br>
<br>
<b>XII.</b> March 6. &shy; On tales of witches, apparitions, &amp;c.
as distinguished from the magic and magicians of Asiatic origin.
The probable sources of the former, and of the belief in them in
certain ages and classes of men. Criteria by which mistaken and
exaggerated facts may be distinguished from absolute falsehood
and imposture. Lastly, the causes of the terror and interest
which stories of ghosts and witches inspire, in early life at
least, whether believed or not.<br>
<br>
<b>XIII.</b> March 10. &shy; On colour, sound, and form in
Nature, as connected with poesy: the word "Poesy" used as the
generic or class term, including poetry, music, painting,
statuary, and ideal architecture, as its species. The reciprocal
relations of poetry and philosophy to each other; and of both to
religion, and the moral sense.<br>
<br>
<b>XIV.</b> March 13. &shy; On the corruptions of the English
language since the reign of Queen Ann, in our style of writing
prose. A few easy rules for the attainment of a manly, unaffected
and pure language, in our genuine mother tongue, whether for the
purpose of writing, oratory, or conversation.</p>

<br>
<h3><a name="section38">Lecture I &shy; General Character of the
Gothic Mind in the Middle Ages</a>
<a href="#fb">1</a></h3>

<p><a name="fbr"></a>Mr. Coleridge began by treating of the races
of mankind as descended from Shem, Ham, and Japhet, and therein
of the early condition of man in his antique form. He then dwelt
on the pre-eminence of the Greeks in Art and Philosophy, and
noticed the suitableness of polytheism to small insulated states,
in which patriotism acted as a substitute for religion, in
destroying or suspending self. Afterwards, in consequence of the
extension of the Roman empire, some universal or common spirit
became necessary for the conservation of the vast body, and this
common spirit was, in fact, produced in Christianity. The causes
of the decline of the Roman empire were in operation long before
the time of the actual overthrow; that overthrow had been
foreseen by many eminent Romans, especially by Seneca. In fact,
there was under the empire an Italian and a German party in Rome,
and in the end the latter prevailed.<br>
<br>
He then proceeded to describe the generic character of the
Northern nations, and defined it as an independence of the whole
in the freedom of the individual, noticing their respect for
women, and their consequent chivalrous spirit in war; and how
evidently the participation in the general council laid the
foundation of the representative form of government, the only
rational mode of preserving individual liberty in opposition to
the licentious democracy of the ancient republics.<br>
<br>
He called our attention to the peculiarity of their art, and
showed how it entirely depended on a symbolical expression of the
infinite, &shy; which is not vastness, nor immensity, nor
perfection, but whatever cannot be circumscribed within the
limits of actual sensuous being. In the ancient art, on the
contrary, every thing was finite and material. Accordingly,
sculpture was not attempted by the Gothic races till the ancient
specimens were discovered, whilst painting and architecture were
of native growth amongst them. In the earliest specimens of the
paintings of modern ages, as in those of Giotto and his
associates in the cemetery at Pisa, this complexity, variety, and
symbolical character are evident, and are more fully developed in
the mightier works of Michel Angelo and Raffael. The
contemplation of the works of antique art excites a feeling of
elevated beauty, and exalted notions of the human self; but the
Gothic architecture impresses the beholder with a sense of
self-annihilation; he becomes, as it were, a part of the work
contemplated. An endless complexity and variety are united into
one whole, the plan of which is not distinct from the execution.
A Gothic cathedral is the petrefaction of our religion. The only
work of truly modern sculpture is the Moses of Michel Angelo.<br>
<br>
The Northern nations were prepared by their own previous religion
for Christianity; they, for the most part, received it gladly,
and it took root as in a native soil. The deference to woman,
characteristic of the Gothic races, combined itself with devotion
in the idea of the Virgin Mother, and gave rise to many beautiful
associations. Mr. C. remarked how Gothic an instrument in origin
and character the organ was.<br>
<br>
He also enlarged on the influence of female character on our
education, the first impressions of our childhood being derived
from women. Amongst oriental nations, he said, the only
distinction was between lord and slave. With the antique Greeks,
the will of every one conflicting with the will of all, produced
licentiousness; with the modern descendants from the northern
stocks, both these extremes were shut out, to reappear mixed and
condensed into this principle or temper; &shy; submission, but
with free choice, &shy; illustrated in chivalrous devotion to

<a name="section39">Lecture II &shy;</a>
<a name="fcr">General Character if the Gothic Literature and Art.</a>
<a href="#fc">1</a></h3>

<p>In my last lecture I stated that the descendants of Japhet and
Shem peopled Europe and Asia, fulfilling in their distribution
the prophecies of Scripture, while the descendants of Ham passed
into Africa, there also actually verifying the interdiction
pronounced against them. The Keltic and Teutonic nations occupied
that part of Europe, which is now France, Britain, Germany,
Sweden, Denmark, &amp;c. They were in general a hardy race,
possessing great fortitude, and capable of great endurance. The
Romans slowly conquered the more southerly portion of their
tribes, and succeeded only by their superior arts, their policy,
and better discipline. After a time, when the Goths, &shy; to use
the name of the noblest and most historical of the Teutonic
tribes, &shy; had acquired some knowledge of these arts from
mixing with their conquerors, they invaded the Roman territories.
The hardy habits, the steady perseverance, the better faith of
the enduring Goth rendered him too formidable an enemy for the
corrupt Roman, who was more inclined to purchase the subjection
of his enemy, than to go through the suffering necessary to
secure it. The conquest of the Romans gave to the Goths the
Christian religion as it was then existing in Italy; and the
light and graceful building of Grecian, or Roman-Greek order,
became singularly combined with the massy architecture of the
Goths, as wild and varied as the forest vegetation which it
resembled. The Greek art is beautiful. When I enter a Greek
church, my eye is charmed, and my mind elated; I feel exalted,
and proud that I am a man. But the Gothic art is sublime. On
entering a cathedral, I am filled with devotion and with awe; I
am lost to the actualities that surround me, and my whole being
expands into the infinite; earth and air, nature and art, all
swell up into eternity, and the only sensible impression left,
is, 'that I am nothing!' This religion, while it tended to soften
the manners of the Northern tribes, was at the same time highly
congenial to their nature. The Goths are free from the stain of
hero worship. Gazing on their rugged mountains, surrounded by
impassable forests, accustomed to gloomy seasons, they lived in
the bosom of nature, and worshipped an invisible and unknown
deity. Firm in his faith, domestic in his habits, the life of the
Goth was simple and dignified, yet tender and affectionate.<br>
<br>
The Greeks were remarkable for complacency and completion; they
delighted in whatever pleased the eye; to them it was not enough
to have merely the idea of a divinity, they must have it placed
before them, shaped in the most perfect symmetry, and presented
with the nicest judgment; and if we look upon any Greek
production of art, the beauty of its parts, and the harmony of
their union, the complete and complacent effect of the whole, are
the striking characteristics. It is the same in their poetry. In
Homer you have a poem perfect in its form, whether originally so,
or from the labour of after critics, I know not; his descriptions
are pictures brought vividly before you, and as far as the eye
and understanding are concerned, I am indeed gratified. But if I
wish my feelings to be affected, if I wish my heart to be
touched, if I wish to melt into sentiment and tenderness, I must
turn to the heroic songs of the Goths, to the poetry of the
middle ages. The worship of statues in Greece had, in a civil
sense, its advantage, and disadvantage; advantage, in promoting
statuary and the arts; disadvantage, in bringing their gods too
much on a level with human beings, and thence depriving them of
their dignity, and gradually giving rise to scepticism and
ridicule. But no statue, no artificial emblem, could satisfy the
Northman's mind; the dark wild imagery of nature, which
surrounded him, and the freedom of his life, gave his mind a
tendency to the infinite, so that he found rest in that which
presented no end, and derived satisfaction from that which was
indistinct.<br>
<br>
We have few and uncertain vestiges of Gothic literature till the
time of Theodoric, who encouraged his subjects to write, and who
made a collection of their poems. These consisted chiefly of
heroic songs, sung at the Court; for at that time this was the
custom. Charlemagne, in the beginning of the ninth century,
greatly encouraged letters, and made a further collection of the
poems of his time, among which were several epic poems of great
merit; or rather in strictness there was a vast cycle of heroic
poems, or minstrelsies, from and out of which separate poems were
composed. The form of poetry was, however, for the most part, the
metrical romance and heroic tale. Charlemagne's army, or a large
division of it, was utterly destroyed in the Pyrenees, when
returning from a successful attack on the Arabs of Navarre and
Arragon; yet the name of Roncesvalles became famous in the songs
of the Gothic poets. The Greeks and Romans would not have done
this; they would not have recorded in heroic verse the death and
defeat of their fellow-countrymen. But the Goths, firm in their
faith, with a constancy not to be shaken, celebrated those brave
men who died for their religion and their country! What, though
they had been defeated, they died without fear, as they had lived
without reproach; they left no stain on their names, for they
fell fighting for their God, their liberty, and their rights; and
the song that sang that day's reverse animated them to future
victory and certain vengeance.<br>
<br>
I must now turn to our great monarch, Alfred, one of the most
august characters that any age has ever produced; and when I
picture him after the toils of government and the dangers of
battle, seated by a solitary lamp, translating the holy
scriptures into the Saxon tongue, &shy; when I reflect on his
moderation in success, on his fortitude and perseverance in
difficulty and defeat, and on the wisdom and extensive nature of
his legislation, I am really at a loss which part of this great
man's character most to admire. Yet above all, I see the
grandeur, the freedom, the mildness, the domestic unity, the
universal character of the middle ages condensed into Alfred's
glorious institution of the trial by jury. I gaze upon it as the
immortal symbol of that age; &shy; an age called indeed dark;
&shy; but how could that age be considered dark, which solved the
difficult problem of universal liberty, freed man from the
shackles of tyranny, and subjected his actions to the decision of
twelve of his fellow countrymen? The liberty of the Greeks was a
phenomenon, a meteor, which blazed for a short time, and then
sank into eternal darkness. It was a combination of most opposite
materials, slavery and liberty. Such can neither be happy nor
lasting. The Goths on the other hand said, You shall be our
Emperor; but we must be Princes on our own estates, and over them
you shall have no power! The Vassals said to their Prince, We
will serve you in your wars, and defend your castle; but we must
have liberty in our own circle, our cottage, our cattle, our
proportion of land. The Cities said, We acknowledge you for our
Emperor; but we must have our walls and our strong holds, and be
governed by our own laws. Thus all combined, yet all were
separate; all served, yet all were free. Such a government could
not exist in a dark age. Our ancestors may not indeed have been
deep in the metaphysics of the schools; they may not have shone
in the fine arts; but much knowledge of human nature, much
practical wisdom must have existed amongst them, when this
admirable constitution was formed; and I believe it is a decided
truth, though certainly an awful lesson, that nations are not the
most happy at the time when literature and the arts flourish the
most among them.<br>
<br>
The translations I had promised in my syllabus I shall defer to
the end of the course, when I shall give a single lecture of
recitations illustrative of the different ages of poetry. There
is one Northern tale I will relate, as it is one from which
Shakspeare derived that strongly marked and extraordinary scene
between Richard III. and the Lady Anne. It may not be equal to
that in strength and genius, but it is, undoubtedly, superior in
decorum and delicacy.<br>
<br>
A Knight had slain a Prince, the lord of a strong castle, in
combat. He afterwards contrived to get into the castle, where he
obtained an interview with the Princess's attendant, whose life
he had saved in some encounter; he told her of his love for her
mistress, and won her to his interest. She then slowly and
gradually worked on her mistress's mind, spoke of the beauty of
his person, the fire of his eyes, the sweetness of his voice, his
valour in the field, his gentleness in the court; in short, by
watching her opportunities, she at last filled the Princess's
soul with this one image; she became restless; sleep forsook her;
her curiosity to see this Knight became strong; but her maid
still deferred the interview, till at length she confessed she
was in love with him; &shy; the Knight is then introduced, and
the nuptials are quickly celebrated.<br>
<br>
In this age there was a tendency in writers to the droll and the
grotesque, and in the little dramas which at that time existed,
there were singular instances of these. It was the disease of the
age. It is a remarkable fact that Luther and Melancthon, the
great religious reformers of that day, should have strongly
recommended for the education of children, dramas, which at
present would be considered highly indecorous, if not bordering
on a deeper sin. From one which they particularly recommended, I
will give a few extracts; more I should not think it right to do.
The play opens with<br>
<br>
Adam and Eve washing and dressing their children to appear before
the Lord, who is coming from heaven to hear them repeat the
Lord's Prayer, Belief, &amp;c. In the next scene the Lord appears
seated like a schoolmaster, with the children standing round,
when Cain, who is behind hand, and a sad pickle, comes running in
with a bloody nose and his hat on. Adam says, "What, with your
hat on!" Cain then goes up to shake hands with the Almighty, when
Adam says (giving him a cuff), "Ah, would you give your left hand
to the Lord?" At length Cain takes his place in the class, and it
becomes his turn to say the Lord's Prayer. At this time the Devil
(a constant attendant at that time) makes his appearance, and
getting behind Cain, whispers in his ear; instead of the Lord's
Prayer, Cain gives it so changed by the transposition of the
words, that the meaning is reversed; yet this is so artfully done
by the author, that it is exactly as an obstinate child would
answer, who knows his lesson, yet does not choose to say it. In
the last scene, horses in rich trappings and carriages covered
with gold are introduced, and the good children are to ride in
them and be Lord Mayors, Lords, &amp;c.; Cain and the bad ones are to
be made cobblers and tinkers, and only to associate with
such.<br>
<br>
This, with numberless others, was written by Hans Sachs. Our
simple ancestors, firm in their faith, and pure in their morals,
were only amused by these pleasantries, as they seemed to them,
and neither they nor the reformers feared their having any
influence hostile to religion. When I was many years back in the
north of Germany, there were several innocent superstitions in
practice. Among others at Christmas, presents used to be given to
the children by the parents, and they were delivered on Christmas
day by a person who personated, and was supposed by the children
to be, Christ: early on Christmas morning he called, knocking
loudly at the door, and (having received his instructions) left
presents for the good and a rod for the bad. Those who have since
been in Germany have found this custom relinquished; it was
considered profane and irrational. Yet they have not found the
children better, nor the mothers more careful of their offspring;
they have not found their devotion more fervent, their faith more
strong, nor their morality more pure. <a href="#fd">2</a><br>

<h3><a name="section40">Lecture III. The Troubadours &shy;
Boccacio &shy; Petrarch &shy; Pulci &shy; Chaucer &shy;
Spenser</a></h3>

<p>The last Lecture (II) was allotted to an investigation into
the origin and character of a species of poetry, the least
influenced of any by the literature of Greece and Rome, &shy;
that in which the portion contributed by the Gothic conquerors,
the predilections and general tone or habit of thought and
feeling, brought by our remote ancestors with them from the
forests of Germany, or the deep dells and rocky mountains of
Norway, are the most prominent. In the present Lecture I must
introduce you to a species of poetry, which had its birth-place
near the centre of Roman glory, and in which, as might be
anticipated, the influences of the Greek and Roman muse are far
more conspicuous, &shy; as great, indeed, as the efforts of
intentional imitation on the part of the poets themselves could
render them. But happily for us and for their own fame, the
intention of the writers as men is often at complete variance
with the genius of the same men as poets. To the force of their
intention we owe their mythological ornaments, and the greater
definiteness of their imagery; and their passion for the
beautiful, the voluptuous, and the artificial, we must in part
attribute to the same intention, but in part likewise to their
natural dispositions and tastes. For the same climate and many of
the same circumstances were acting on them, which had acted on
the great classics, whom they were endeavouring to imitate. But
the love of the marvellous, the deeper sensibility, the higher
reverence for womanhood, the characteristic spirit of sentiment
and courtesy, &shy; these were the heir-looms of nature, which
still regained the ascendant, whenever the use of the living
mother-language enabled the inspired poet to appear instead of
the toilsome scholar.<br>
<br>
From this same union, in which the soul (if I may dare so express
myself) was Gothic, while the outward forms and a majority of the
words themselves, were the reliques of the Roman, arose the
Romance, or romantic language, in which the Troubadours or
Love-singers of Provence sang and wrote, and the different
dialects of which have been modified into the modern Italian,
Spanish, and Portuguese; while the language of the Trouveurs,
Trouveres, or Norman-French poets, forms the intermediate link
between the Romance or modified Roman, and the Teutonic,
including the Dutch, Danish, Swedish, and the upper and lower
German, as being the modified Gothic. And as the northernmost
extreme of the Norman-French, or that part of the link in which
it formed on the Teutonic, we must take the Norman-English
minstrels and metrical romances, from the greater predominance of
the Anglo-Saxon Gothic in the derivation of the words. I mean,
that the language of the English metrical romance is less
romanized, and has fewer words, not originally of a northern
origin, than the same romances in the Norman- French; which is
the more striking, because the former were for the most part
translated from the latter; the authors of which seem to have
eminently merited their name of <i>Trouveres</i>, or inventors.
Thus then we have a chain with two rings or staples:&shy; at the
southern end there is the Roman, or Latin; at the northern end
the Keltic, Teutonic, or Gothic; and the links beginning with the
southern end, are the Romance, including the Proven&ccedil;al,
the Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese, with their different
dialects, then the Norman-French, and lastly the English.<br>
<br>
My object in adverting to the Italian poets, is not so much for
their own sakes, in which point of view Dante and Ariosto alone
would have required separate Lectures, but for the elucidation of
the merits of our countrymen, as to what extent we must consider
them as fortunate imitators of their Italian predecessors, and in
what points they have the higher claims of original genius. Of
Dante, I am to speak elsewhere. Of Boccaccio, who has little
interest as a metrical poet in any respect, and none for my
present purpose, except, perhaps, as the reputed inventor or
introducer of the octave stanza in his <i>Teseide</i>, it will be
sufficient to say, that we owe to him the subjects of numerous
poems taken from his famous tales, the happy art of narration,
and the still greater merit of a depth and fineness in the
workings of the passions, in which last excellence, as likewise
in the wild and imaginative character of the situations, his
almost neglected romances appear to me greatly to excel his far
famed <i>Decameron</i>. To him, too, we owe the more doubtful
merit of having introduced into the Italian prose, and by the
authority of his name and the influence of his example, more or
less throughout Europe, the long interwoven periods, and
architectural structure which arose from the very nature of their
language in the Greek writers, but which already in the Latin
orators and historians, had betrayed a species of effort, a
foreign something, which had been superinduced on the language,
instead of growing out of it; and which was far too alien from
that individualizing and confederating, yet not blending,
character of the North, to become permanent, although its
magnificence and stateliness were objects of admiration and
occasional imitation. This style diminished the control of the
writer over the inner feelings of men, and created too great a
charm between the body and the life; and hence especially it was
abandoned by Luther.<br>
<br>
But lastly, to Boccaccio's sanction we must trace a large portion
of the mythological pedantry and incongruous paganisms, which for
so long a period deformed the poetry, even of the truest poets.
To such an extravagance did Boccaccio himself carry this folly,
that in a romance of chivalry, he has uniformly styled God the
Father Jupiter, our Saviour Apollo, and the Evil Being Pluto. But
for this there might be some excuse pleaded. I dare make none for
the gross and disgusting licentiousness, the daring profaneness,
which rendered the <i>Decameron</i> of Boccaccio the parent of a
hundred worse children, fit to be classed among the enemies of
the human race; which poisons <i>Ariosto</i> &shy; (for that I
may not speak oftener than necessary of so odious a subject, I
mention it here once for all) &shy; which interposes a painful
mixture in the humour of Chaucer, and which has once or twice
seduced even our pure-minded Spenser into a grossness, as
heterogeneous from the spirit of his great poem, as it was alien
to the delicacy of his morals.<br>

<h3>Luigi Pulci</h3>

<br>
Born at Florence, 1431. &shy; Died about 1487.<br>
<br>
Pulci was of one of the noblest families in Florence, reported to
be one of the Frankish stocks which remained in that city after
the departure of Charlemagne:&shy; <br>
<blockquote>Pulcia Gallorum soboles descendit in urbem,<br>
 Clara quidem bello, sacris nec inhospita Musis.<br>
<br>
 (Verino <i>De illustrat. Cort. Flor.</i> III. v.
118.)</blockquote>

<br>
Members of this family were five times elected to the Priorate,
one of the highest honours of the republic. Pulci had two
brothers, and one of their wives, Antonia, who were all
poets:&shy; <br>
<blockquote>Carminibus patriis notissima Pulcia proles;<br>
 Quis non hanc urbem Musarum dicat arnicam,<br>
 Si tres producat fratres domus una poetas?<br>
<br>
 (<i>Ib.</i> II. v. 241.)</blockquote>

<br>
 <a name="fgr"></a>Luigi married Lucrezia di Uberto, of the
Albizzi family, and was intimate with the great men of his time,
but more especially with Angelo Politian, and Lorenzo the
Magnificent. His <i>Morgante</i> has been attributed, in part at
least <a href="#fg">1</a>, to the assistance of Marsilius
Ficinus, and by others the whole has been attributed to Politian.
The first conjecture is utterly improbable; the last is possible,
indeed, on account of the licentiousness of the poem; but there
are no direct grounds for believing it. <a name="fhr"></a>The
<i>Morgante Maggiore</i> <a href="#fh">2</a> is the first proper
romance; although, perhaps, Pulci had the <i>Teseide</i> before
him. The story is taken from the fabulous history of Turpin; and
if the author had any distinct object, it seems to have been that
of making himself merry with the absurdities of the old
romancers. The <i>Morgante</i> sometimes makes you think of
Rabelais. <a name="fir"></a>It contains the most remarkable guess
or allusion upon the subject of America that can be found in any
book published before the discovery <a href="#fi">3</a>. The well
known passage in the tragic Seneca is not to be compared with it.
The <i>copia verborum</i> of the mother Florentine tongue, and
the easiness of his style, afterwards brought to perfection by
Berni, are the chief merits of Pulci; his chief demerit is his
heartless spirit of jest and buffoonery, by which sovereigns and
their courtiers were flattered by the degradation of nature, and
the <i>impossibilification</i> of a pretended virtue.<br>

<h3>Chaucer</h3>

 Born in London, 1328. &shy;Died 1400. <a href="#fj">1</a><br>
<br>
Chaucer must be read with an eye to the Norman-French Trouveres,
of whom he is the best representative in English. He had great
powers of invention. As in Shakspeare, his characters represent
classes, but in a different manner; Shakspeare's characters are
the representatives of the interior nature of humanity, in which
some element has become so predominant as to destroy the health
of the mind; whereas Chaucer's are rather representatives of
classes of manners. He is therefore more led to individualize in
a mere personal sense. Observe Chaucer's love of nature; and how
happily the subject of his main work is chosen. When you reflect
that the company in the <i>Decameron</i> have retired to a place
of safety from the raging of a pestilence, their mirth provokes a
sense of their unfeelingness; whereas in Chaucer nothing of this
sort occurs, and the scheme of a party on a pilgrimage, with
different ends and occupations, aptly allows of the greatest
variety of expression in the tales. ...<br>

<h3>Spenser</h3>

<br>
Born in London, 1553. &shy;Died 1599.<br>
<br>
There is this difference, among many others, between Shakspeare
and Spenser:&shy; Shakspeare is never coloured by the customs of
his age; what appears of contemporary character in him is merely
negative; it is just not something else. He has none of the
fictitious realities of the classics, none of the grotesquenesses
of chivalry, none of the allegory of the middle ages; there is no
sectarianism either of politics or religion, no miser, no witch,
&shy; no common witch, &shy; no astrology &shy; nothing
impermanent of however long duration; but he stands like the yew
tree in Lorton vale, which has known so many ages that it belongs
to none in particular; a living image of endless
self-reproduction, like the immortal tree of Malabar. In Spenser
the spirit of chivalry is entirely predominant, although with a
much greater infusion of the poet's own individual self into it
than is found in any other writer. He has the wit of the southern
with the deeper inwardness of the northern genius.<br>
<br>
No one can appreciate Spenser without some reflection on the
nature of allegorical writing. The mere etymological meaning of
the word, allegory, &shy; to talk of one thing and thereby convey
another, &shy; is too wide. The true sense is this, &shy; the
employment of one set of agents and images to convey in disguise
a moral meaning, with a likeness to the imagination, but with a
difference to the understanding, &shy; those agents and images
being so combined as to form a homogeneous whole. This
distinguishes it from metaphor, which is part of an allegory. But
allegory is not properly distinguishable from fable, otherwise
than as the first includes the second, as a genus its species;
for in a fable there must be nothing but what is universally
known and acknowledged, but in an allegory there may be that
which is new and not previously admitted. The pictures of the
great masters, especially of the Italian schools, are genuine
allegories. <a name="fkr"></a>Amongst the classics, the multitude
of their gods either precluded allegory altogether, or else made
every thing allegory, as in the Hesiodic <i>Theogonia</i>; for
you can scarcely distinguish between power and the
personification of power. <i>The Cupid and Psyche</i> of, or
found in, Apuleius, is a phenomenon. It is the Platonic mode of
accounting for the fall of man. The <i>Battle of the Soul</i> <a
href="#fk">1</a> by Prudentius is an early instance of Christian
allegory.<br>
<br>
Narrative allegory is distinguished from mythology as reality
from symbol; it is, in short, the proper intermedium between
person and personification. Where it is too strongly
individualized, it ceases to be allegory; this is often felt in
the <i>Pilgrim's Progress</i>, where the characters are real
persons with nick names. Perhaps one of the most curious warnings
against another attempt at narrative allegory on a great scale,
may be found in Tasso's account of what he himself intended in
and by his <i>Jerusalem Delivered</i>.<br>
<br>
<br>
 <b>(1)</b>  As characteristic of Spenser, I would call your
particular attention in the first place to the indescribable
sweetness and fluent projection of his verse, very clearly
distinguishable from the deeper and more inwoven harmonies of
Shakspeare and Milton. This stanza is a good instance of what I
mean:&shy; <br>
<blockquote>Yet she, most faithfull ladie, all this while<br>
 Forsaken, wofull, solitarie mayd,<br>
 Far from all peoples preace, as in exile,<br>
 In wildernesse and wastfull deserts strayd<br>
 To seeke her knight; who, subtily betrayd<br>
 Through that late vision which th' enchaunter wrought,<br>
 Had her abandond; she, of nought affrayd,<br>
 Through woods and wastnes wide him daily sought,<br>
 Yet wished tydinges none of him unto her brought.<br>
<br>
 (<i>F. Qu.</i>. B. I. c. 3. st. 3.)</blockquote>

<br>
<br>
 <b>2.</b>  Combined with this sweetness and fluency, the
scientific construction of the metre of the <i>Faery Queene</i>
is very noticeable. One of Spenser's arts is that of
alliteration, and he uses it with great effect in doubling the
impression of an image:&shy; <br>


<blockquote>In <b>w</b>ildernesse and <b>w</b>astful deserts,
&shy;<br>
 Through <b>w</b>oods and <b>w</b>astnes <b>w</b>ilde, &shy;<br>
 They passe the bitter <b>w</b>aves of Acheron,<br>
 Where many soules sit <b>w</b>ailing <b>w</b>oefully,<br>
 And come to <b>f</b>iery <b>f</b>lood of <b>Ph</b>legeton,<br>
 Whereas the damned ghosts in torments <b>f</b>ry,<br>
 And with <b>sh</b>arp <b>sh</b>rilling <b>sh</b>rieks doth
bootlesse cry, &shy; &amp;c.</blockquote>

He is particularly given to an alternate alliteration, which is,
perhaps, when well used, a great secret in melody:&shy; <br>


<blockquote>A <b>r</b>amping lyon <b>r</b>ushed suddenly, &shy;
And <b>s</b>ad to <b>s</b>ee her <b>s</b>orrowful
con<b>s</b>traint, &shy;<br>
 And on the grasse her <b>d</b>aintie <b>l</b>imbes <b>d</b>id
<b>l</b>ay, &shy; &amp;c.</blockquote>

You cannot read a page of the <i>Faery Queene</i>, if you read
for that purpose, without perceiving the intentional
alliterativeness of the words; and yet so skilfully is this
managed, that it never strikes any unwarned ear as artificial, or
other than the result of the necessary movement of the verse.<br>
<br>
<br>
 <b>3.</b>  Spenser displays great skill in harmonizing his
descriptions of external nature and actual incidents with the
allegorical character and epic activity of the poem. Take these
two beautiful passages as illustrations of what I mean:&shy; <br>


<blockquote>By this the northerne wagoner had set<br>
 His sevenfol teme behind the stedfast starre<br>
 That was in ocean waves yet never wet,<br>
 But firme is fixt, and sendeth light from farre<br>
 To all that in the wide deepe wandring arre;<br>
 And chearefull chaunticlere with his note shrill<br>
 Had warned once, that Phoebus' fiery carre<br>
 In hast was climbing up the easterne hill,<br>
 Full envious that Night so long his roome did fill;<br>
<br>
 <i>When</i> those accursed messengers of hell,<br>
 That feigning dreame, and that faire-forged spright<br>
 Came, &amp;c.<br>
<br>
 (B. I. c. 2. st. 1.)<br>
<br>
...<br>
<br>
 At last, the golden orientall gate<br>
 Of greatest Heaven gan to open fayre;<br>
 And Phoebus, fresh as brydegrome to his mate,<br>
 Came dauncing forth, shaking his deawie hayre;<br>
 And hurld his glistring beams through gloomy ayre.<br>
 <i>Which when</i> the wakeful Elfe perceiv'd, streightway<br>
 He started up, and did him selfe prepayre<br>
 In sunbright armes and battailons array;<br>
 For with that Pagan proud he combat will that day.<br>
<br>
 (<i>Ib.</i> c. 5. st. 2.)</blockquote>

<br>
 Observe also the exceeding vividness of Spenser's descriptions.
They are not, in the true sense of the word, picturesque; but are
composed of a wondrous series of images, as in our dreams.
Compare the following passage with any thing you may remember
<i>in pari materia</i> in Milton or Shakspeare:&shy; <br>


<blockquote>His haughtie helmet, horrid all with gold,<br>
 Both glorious brightnesse and great terrour bredd<br>
 For all the crest a dragon did enfold<br>
 With greedie pawes, and over all did spredd<br>
 His golden winges; his dreadfull hideous hedd,<br>
 Close couched on the bever, seemd to throw<br>
 From flaming mouth bright sparkles fiery redd,<br>
 That suddeine horrour to faint hartes did show;<br>
 And scaly tayle was stretcht adowne his back full low.<br>
<br>
 Upon the top of all his loftie crest<br>
 A bounch of haires discolourd diversly,<br>
 With sprinkled pearle and gold full richly drest,<br>
 Did shake, and seemd to daunce for jollitie;<br>
 Like to an almond tree ymounted hye<br>
 On top of greene Selinis all alone,<br>
 With blossoms brave bedecked daintily,<br>
 Whose tender locks do tremble every one<br>
 At everie little breath that under heaven is blowne.<br>
<br>
 (<i>Ib.</i> c. 7. st. 31-2.)</blockquote>

<br>
<br>
 <b>4.</b>  You will take especial note of the marvellous
independence and true imaginative absence of all particular space
or time in the <i>Faery Queene</i>. It is in the domains neither
of history or geography; it is ignorant of all artificial
boundary, all material obstacles; it is truly in land of Faery,
that is, of mental space. The poet has placed you in a dream, a
charmed sleep, and you neither wish, nor have the power, to
inquire where you are, or how you got there. It reminds me of
some lines of my own:&shy; <br>


<blockquote>Oh! would to Alla!<br>
The raven or the sea-mew were appointed<br>
 To bring me food! &shy; or rather that my soul<br>
 Might draw in life from the universal air!<br>
 It were a lot divine in some small skiff<br>
 Along some ocean's boundless solitude<br>
 To float for ever with a careless course<br>
 And think myself the only being alive!<br>
<br>
 (<i>Remorse</i>, Act iv. sc. 3.)</blockquote>

<br>
 Indeed Spenser himself, in the conduct of his great poem, may be
represented under the same image, his symbolizing purpose being
his mariner's compass:&shy; <br>


<blockquote>As pilot well expert in perilous wave,<br>
 That to a stedfast starre his course hath bent,<br>
 When foggy mistes or cloudy tempests have<br>
 The faithfull light of that faire lampe yblent,<br>
 And coverd Heaven with hideous dreriment;<br>
 Upon his card and compas firmes his eye,<br>
 The maysters of his long experiment,<br>
 And to them does the steddy helme apply,<br>
 Bidding his winged vessell fairely forward fly.<br>
<br>
 (B. II. c. 7. st. 1.)</blockquote>

<br>
 So the poet through the realms of allegory.<br>
<br>
<br>
 <b>5.</b>  You should note the quintessential character of
Christian chivalry in all his characters, but more especially in
his women. The Greeks, except, perhaps, in Homer, seem to have
had no way of making their women interesting, but by unsexing
them, as in the instances of the tragic Medea, Electra, &amp;c.
Contrast such characters with Spenser's Una, who exhibits no
prominent feature, has no particularization, but produces the
same feeling that a statue does, when contemplated at a
distance:&shy; <br>


<blockquote>From her fayre head her fillet she undight,<br>
 And layd her stole aside: her angels face,<br>
 As the great eye of Heaven, shyned bright,<br>
 And made a sunshine in the shady place;<br>
 Did never mortal eye behold such heavenly grace.<br>
<br>
 (B. I. c. 3. st. 4.)</blockquote>

<br>
<br>
 <b>6.</b>  In Spenser we see the brightest and purest form of
that nationality which was so common a characteristic of our
elder poets. There is nothing unamiable, nothing contemptuous of
others, in it. To glorify their country &shy; to elevate England
into a queen, an empress of the heart &shy; this was their
passion and object; and how dear and important an object it was
or may be, let Spain, in the recollection of her Cid, declare!
There is a great magic in national names. What a damper to all
interest is a list of native East Indian merchants! Unknown names
are non-conductors; they stop all sympathy. No one of our poets
has touched this string more exquisitely than Spenser; especially
in his chronicle of the British Kings (B. II. c. 10.), and the
marriage of the Thames with the Medway (B. IV. c. 11.), in both
which passages the mere names constitute half the pleasure we
receive. To the same feeling we must in particular attribute
Spenser's sweet reference to Ireland:&shy; <br>


<blockquote>Ne thence the Irishe rivers absent were;<br>
 Sith no lesse famous than the rest they be, &amp;c.<br>
<br>
 (<i>Ib.</i>)<br>
<br>
 ...<br>
<br>
 And Mulla mine, whose waves I whilom taught to weep.<br>
<br>
 (<i>Ib.</i>)</blockquote>

<br>
 And there is a beautiful passage of the same sort in the Colin
Clout's <i>Come Home Again</i>:&shy; <br>


<blockquote>"One day," quoth he, "I sat, as was my trade,<br>
 Under the foot of Mole," &amp;c.</blockquote>

<br>
 Lastly, the great and prevailing character of Spenser's mind is
fancy under the conditions of imagination, as an ever present but
not always active power. He has an imaginative fancy, but he has
not imagination, in kind or degree, as Shakspeare and Milton
have; the boldest effort of his powers in this way is the
character of Talus. <a href="#fl">2</a> Add to this a feminine
tenderness and almost maidenly purity of feeling, and above all,
a deep moral earnestness which produces a believing sympathy and
acquiescence in the reader, and you have a tolerably adequate
view of Spenser's intellectual being.<br>

<h3><a name="section41">Lecture VII. Ben Jonson, Beaumont and
Fletcher, and Massinger</a></h3>

<p>A contemporary is rather an ambiguous term, when applied to
authors. It may simply mean that one man lived and wrote while
another was yet alive, however deeply the former may have been
indebted to the latter as his model. There have been instances in
the literary world that might remind a botanist of a singular
sort of parasite plant, which rises above ground, independent and
unsupported, an apparent original; but trace its roots, and you
will find the fibres all terminating in the root of another plant
at an unsuspected distance, which, perhaps, from want of sun and
genial soil, and the loss of sap, has scarcely been able to peep
above the ground. &shy; Or the word may mean those whose
compositions were contemporaneous in such a sense as to preclude
all likelihood of the one having borrowed from the other. In the
latter sense I should call Ben Jonson a contemporary of
Shakspeare, though he long survived him; while I should prefer
the phrase of immediate successors for Beaumont and Fletcher, and
Massinger, though they too were Shakspeare's contemporaries in
the former sense.<br>
<br>
</p>

<hr width="50%" align="center">
<h3>Ben Jonson  <a href="#fm">1</a></h3>

<br>
<a name="fmr"></a>Born, 1754. &shy;Died, 1637<br>
<br>
Ben Jonson is original; he is, indeed, the only one of the great
dramatists of that day who was not either directly produced, or
very greatly modified, by Shakspeare. In truth, he differs from
our great master in every thing &shy; in form and in substance
&shy; and betrays no tokens of his proximity. He is not original
in the same way as Shakspeare is original; but after a fashion of
his own, Ben Jonson is most truly original.<br>
<br>
The characters in his plays are, in the strictest sense of the
term, abstractions. Some very prominent feature is taken from the
whole man, and that single feature or humour is made the basis
upon which the entire character is built up. Ben Jonson's
<i>dramatis personae</i> are almost as fixed as the masks of the
ancient actors; you know from the first scene &shy; sometimes
from the list of names &shy; exactly what every one of them is to
be. He was a very accurately observing man; but he cared only to
observe what was external or open to, and likely to impress, the
senses. He individualizes, not so much, if at all, by the
exhibition of moral or intellectual differences, as by the
varieties and contrasts of manners, modes of speech and tricks of
temper; as in such characters as Puntarvolo, Bobadill, &amp;c.<br>
<br>
I believe there is not one whim or affectation in common life
noted in any memoir of that age which may not be found drawn and
framed in some corner or other of Ben Jonson's dramas; and they
have this merit, in common with Hogarth's prints, that not a
single circumstance is introduced in them which does not play
upon, and help to bring out, the dominant humour or humours of
the piece. Indeed I ought very particularly to call your
attention to the extraordinary skill shown by Ben Jonson in
contriving situations for the display of his characters. In fact,
his care and anxiety in this matter led him to do what scarcely
any of the dramatists of that age did &shy; that is, invent his
plots. It is not a first perusal that suffices for the full
perception of the elaborate artifice of the plots of the
<i>Alchemist</i> and the <i>Silent Woman</i>; &shy; that of the
former is absolute perfection for a necessary entanglement, and
an unexpected, yet natural, evolution.<br>
<br>
Ben Jonson exhibits a sterling English diction, and he has with
great skill contrived varieties of construction; but his style is
rarely sweet or harmonious, in consequence of his labour at point
and strength being so evident. In all his works, in verse or
prose, there is an extraordinary opulence of thought; but it is
the produce of an amassing power in the author, and not of a
growth from within. Indeed a large proportion of Ben Jonson's
thoughts may be traced to classic or obscure modern writers, by
those who are learned and curious enough to follow the steps of
this robust, surly, and observing dramatist.<br>

<a name="fnr"></a>Mr. Weber, to whose taste, industry, and
appropriate erudition we owe, I will not say the best, (for that
would be saying little,) but a good, edition of Beaumont and
Fletcher, has complimented the <i>Philaster</i>, which he himself
describes as inferior to the <i>Maid's Tragedy</i> by the same
writers, as but little below the noblest of Shakspeare's plays,
<i>Lear</i>, <i>Macbeth</i>, <i>Othello</i>, &amp;c. and consequently
implying the equality, at least, of the <i>Maid's Tragedy</i>;
&shy; and an eminent living critic, &shy; who in the manly wit,
strong sterling sense, and robust style of his original works,
had presented the best possible credentials of office as
<i>charg&eacute; d'affaires</i> of literature in general, &shy;
and who by his edition of Massinger &shy; a work in which there
was more for an editor to do, and in which more was actually well
done, than in any similar work within my knowledge &shy; has
proved an especial right of authority in the appreciation of
dramatic poetry, and hath potentially a double voice with the
public in his own right and in that of the critical synod, where,
as <i>princeps senatus</i>, he possesses it by his prerogative,
&shy; has affirmed that Shakspeare's superiority to his
contemporaries rests on his superior wit alone, while in all the
other, and, as I should deem, higher excellencies of the drama,
character, pathos, depth of thought, &amp;c. he is equalled by
Beaumont and Fletcher, Ben Jonson, and Massinger! <a href=
"#fn">1</a><br>
<br>
Of wit I am engaged to treat in another Lecture. It is a genus of
many species; and at present I shall only say, that the species
which is predominant in Shakspeare, is so completely
Shakspearian, and in its essence so interwoven with all his other
characteristic excellencies, that I am equally incapable of
comprehending, both how it can be detached from his other powers,
and how, being disparate in kind from the wit of contemporary
dramatists, it can be compared with theirs in degree. And again
&shy; the detachment and the practicability of the comparison
being granted &shy; I should, I confess, be rather inclined to
concede the contrary; &shy; and in the most common species of
wit, and in the ordinary application of the term, to yield this
particular palm to Beaumont and Fletcher, whom here and hereafter
I take as one poet with two names, &shy; leaving undivided what a
rare love and still rarer congeniality have united. At least, I
have never been able to distinguish the presence of Fletcher
during the life of Beaumont, nor the absence of Beaumont during
the survival of Fletcher.<br>
<br>
But waiving, or rather deferring, this question, I protest
against the remainder of the position <i>in toto</i>. And indeed,
whilst I can never, I trust, show myself blind to the various
merits of Jonson, Beaumont and Fletcher, and Massinger, or
insensible to the greatness of the merits which they possess in
common, or to the specific excellencies which give to each of the
three a worth of his own, &shy; I confess, that one main object
of this Lecture was to prove that Shakspeare's eminence is his
own, and not that of his age; &shy; even as the pine-apple, the
melon, and the gourd may grow on the same bed; &shy; yea, the
same circumstances of warmth and soil may be necessary to their
full development, yet do not account for the golden hue, the
ambrosial flavour, the perfect shape of the pine-apple, or the
tufted crown on its head. Would that those, who seek to twist it
off, could but promise us in this instance to make it the germ of
an equal successor!<br>
<br>
What had a grammatical and logical consistency for the ear, &shy;
what could be put together and represented to the eye &shy; these
poets took from the ear and eye, unchecked by any intuition of an
inward impossibility; &shy; just as a man might put together a
quarter of an orange, a quarter of an apple, and the like of a
lemon and a pomegranate, and make it look like one round
diverse-coloured fruit. But nature, which works from within by
evolution and assimilation according to a law, cannot do so, nor
could Shakspeare; for he too worked in the spirit of nature, by
evolving the germ from within by the imaginative power according
to an idea. For as the power of seeing is to light, so is an idea
in mind to a law in nature. They are correlatives, which suppose
each other.<br>
<br>
The plays of Beaumont and Fletcher are mere aggregations without
unity; in the Shakspearian drama there is a vitality which grows
and evolves itself from within, &shy; a key note which guides and
controls the harmonies throughout. What is <i>Lear</i>? &shy; It
is storm and tempest &shy; the thunder at first grumbling in the
far horizon, then gathering around us, and at length bursting in
fury over our heads, &shy; succeeded by a breaking of the clouds
for a while, a last flash of lightning, the closing in of night,
and the single hope of darkness! And <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>?
&shy; It is a spring day, gusty and beautiful in the morn, and
closing like an April evening with the song of the nightingale;
&shy; whilst <i>Macbeth</i> is deep and earthy, &shy; composed to
the subterranean music of a troubled conscience, which converts
every thing into the wild and fearful!<br>
<br>
Doubtless from mere observation, or from the occasional
similarity of the writer's own character, more or less in
Beaumont and Fletcher, and other such writers will happen to be
in correspondence with nature, and still more in apparent
compatibility with it. But yet the false source is always
discoverable, first by the gross contradictions to nature in so
many other parts, and secondly, by the want of the impression
which Shakspeare makes, that the thing said not only might have
been said, but that nothing else could be substituted, so as to
excite the same sense of its exquisite propriety. I have always
thought the conduct and expressions of Othello and Iago in the
last scene, when Iago is brought in prisoner, a wonderful
instance of Shakspeare's consummate judgment:&shy;<br>


<blockquote><i>Oth.</i> I look down towards his feet; &shy; but
that's a fable.<br>
 If that thou be'st a devil, I cannot kill thee.<br>
<br>
 <i>Iago.</i> I bleed, Sir; but not kill'd.<br>
<br>
 <i>Oth.</i> I am not sorry neither.</blockquote>

<br>
 Think what a volley of execrations and defiances Beaumont and
Fletcher would have poured forth here!<br>
<br>
Indeed Massinger and Ben Jonson are both more perfect in their
kind than Beaumont and Fletcher; the former in the story and
affecting incidents; the latter in the exhibition of manners and
peculiarities, whims in language, and vanities of appearance.<br>
<br>
There is, however, a diversity of the most dangerous kind here.
Shakspeare shaped his characters out of the nature within; but we
cannot so safely say, out of his own nature as an individual
person. No! this latter is itself but a <i>natura naturata</i>,
&shy; an effect, a product, not a power. It was Shakspeare's
prerogative to have the universal, which is potentially in each
particular, opened out to him, the <i>homo generalis</i>, not as
an abstraction from observation of a variety of men, but as the
substance capable of endless modifications, of which his own
personal existence was but one, and to use this one as the eye
that beheld the other, and as the tongue that could convey the
discovery. There is no greater or more common vice in dramatic
writers than to draw out of themselves. How I &shy; alone and in
the self-sufficiency of my study, as all men are apt to be proud
in their dreams &shy; should like to be talking <i>king</i>!
Shakspeare, in composing, had no <i>I</i>, but the <i>I</i>
representative. In Beaumont and Fletcher you have descriptions of
characters by the poet rather than the characters themselves; we
are told, and impressively told, of their being; but we rarely or
never feel that they actually are.<br>
<br>
Beaumont and Fletcher are the most lyrical of our dramatists. I
think their comedies the best part of their works, although there
are scenes of very deep tragic interest in some of their plays. I
particularly recommend <i>Monsieur Thomas</i> for good pure comic
humor.<br>
<br>
<a name="for"></a>There is, occasionally, considerable license in
their dramas; and this opens a subject much needing vindication
and sound exposition, but which is beset with such difficulties
for a Lecturer, that I must pass it by. Only as far as Shakspeare
is concerned, I own, I can with less pain admit a fault in him
than beg an excuse for it. I will not, therefore, attempt to
palliate the grossness that actually exists in his plays by the
customs of his age, or by the far greater coarseness of all his
contemporaries, excepting Spenser, who is himself not wholly
blameless, though nearly so; &shy; for I place Shakspeare's merit
on being of no age. But I would clear away what is, in my
judgment, not his, as that scene of the Porter <a href=
"#fo">2</a> in <i>Macbeth</i>, and many other such passages, and
abstract what is coarse in manners only, and all that which from
the frequency of our own vices, we associate with his words. If
this were truly done, little that could be justly reprehensible
would remain. Compare the vile comments, offensive and defensive,
on Pope's <br>
<blockquote>Lust thro' some gentle strainers, &amp;c.</blockquote>

with the worst thing in Shakspeare, or even in Beaumont and
Fletcher; and then consider how unfair the attack is on our old
dramatists; especially because it is an attack that cannot be
properly answered in that presence in which an answer would be
most desirable, from the painful nature of one part of the
position; but this very pain is almost a demonstration of its
falsehood!<br>

<h3>Massinger</h3>

<br>
 Born at Salisbury, 1584. &shy;Died, 1640.<br>
<br>
With regard to Massinger, observe,<br>
<br>
 <b>1.</b>  The vein of satire on the times; but this is not as
in Shakspeare, where the natures evolve themselves according to
their incidental disproportions, from excess, deficiency, or
mislocation, of one or more of the component elements; but is
merely satire on what is attributed to them by others.<br>
<br>
<b>2.</b>  His excellent metre &shy; a better model for
dramatists in general to imitate than Shakspeare's, &shy; even if
a dramatic taste existed in the frequenters of the stage, and
could be gratified in the present size and management, or rather
mismanagement, of the two patent theatres. I do not mean that
Massinger's verse is superior to Shakspeare's or equal to it. Far
from it; but it is much more easily constructed and may be more
successfully adopted by writers in the present day. It is the
nearest approach to the language of real life at all compatible
with a fixed metre. In Massinger, as in all our poets before
Dryden, in order to make harmonious verse in the reading, it is
absolutely necessary that the meaning should be understood; &shy;
when the meaning is once seen, then the harmony is perfect.
Whereas in Pope and in most of the writers who followed in his
school, it is the mechanical metre which determines the
sense.<br>
<br>
<b>3.</b>  The impropriety, and indecorum of demeanour in his
favourite characters, as in Bertoldo in the <i>Maid of
Honour</i>, who is a swaggerer, talking to his sovereign what no
sovereign could endure, and to gentlemen what no gentleman would
answer without pulling his nose.<br>
<br>
<b>4.</b>  Shakspeare's Ague-cheek, Osric, &amp;c. are displayed
through others, in the course of social intercourse, by the mode
of their performing some office in which they are employed; but
Massinger's <i>Sylli</i> come forward to declare themselves fools
<i>ad arbitrium auctoris,</i> and so the diction always needs the
<i>subintelligitur</i> ('the man looks as if he thought so and
so,') expressed in the language of the satirist, and not in that
of the man himself:&shy; <br>


<blockquote><i>Sylli.</i> You may, madam,<br>
Perhaps, believe that I in this use art<br>
To make you dote upon me, by exposing<br>
My more than most rare features to your view;<br>
But I, as I have ever done, deal simply,<br>
A mark of sweet simplicity, ever noted<br>
In the family of the Syllis. Therefore, lady,<br>
Look not with too much contemplation on me;<br>
If you do, you are in the suds.<br>
<br>
 <i>Maid of Honour</i>, act i. sc. 2.</blockquote>

<br>
 The author mixes his own feelings and judgments concerning the
presumed fool; but the man himself, till mad, fights up against
them, and betrays, by his attempts to modify them, that he is no
fool at all, but one gifted with activity and copiousness of
thought, image and expression, which belong not to a fool, but to
a man of wit making himself merry with his own character.<br>
<br>
<b>5.</b>  There is an utter want of preparation in the decisive
acts of Massinger's characters, as in Camiola and Aurelia in the
<i>Maid of Honour</i>. Why? Because the <i>dramatis personae</i>
were all planned each by itself. Whereas in Shakspeare, the play
is <i>syngenesia;</i> each character has, indeed, a life of its
own, and is an <i>individuum</i> of itself, but yet an organ of
the whole, as the heart in the human body. Shakspeare was a great
comparative anatomist.<br>
<br>
Hence Massinger and all, indeed, but Shakspeare, take a dislike
to their own characters, and spite themselves upon them by making
them talk like fools or monsters; as Fulgentio in his visit to
Camiola, (Act ii. sc. 2.) Hence too, in Massinger, the continued
flings at kings, courtiers, and all the favourites of fortune,
like one who had enough of intellect to see injustice in his own
inferiority in the share of the good things of life, but not
genius enough to rise above it, and forget himself. Beaumont and
Fletcher have the same vice in the opposite pole, a servility of
sentiment and a spirit of partizanship with the monarchical
faction.<br>
<br>
<b>6.</b>  From the want of a guiding point in Massinger's
characters, you never know what they are about. In fact they have
no character.<br>
<br>
<b>7.</b>  Note the faultiness of his soliloquies, with
connectives and arrangements, that have no other motive but the
fear lest the audience should not understand him.<br>
<br>
<b>8.</b>  A play of Massinger's produces no one single effect,
whether arising from the spirit of the whole, as in the <i>As You
Like It</i>; or from any one indisputably prominent character as
Hamlet. It is just "which you like best, gentlemen!"<br>
<br>
<b>9.</b>  The unnaturally irrational passions and strange whims
of feeling which Massinger delights to draw, deprive the reader
of all sound interest in the characters; &shy; as in Mathias in
the <i>Picture</i>, and in other instances.<br>
<br>
<b>10.</b>  The comic scenes in Massinger not only do not
harmonize with the tragic, not only interrupt the feeling, but
degrade the characters that are to form any part in the action of
the piece, so as to render them unfit for any tragic interest. At
least, they do not concern, or act upon, or modify, the principal
characters. As when a gentleman is insulted by a mere blackguard,
&shy; it is the same as if any other accident of nature had
occurred, a pig run under his legs, or his horse thrown him.
There is no dramatic interest in it.<br>
<br>
I like Massinger's comedies better than his tragedies, although
where the situation requires it, he often rises into the truly
tragic and pathetic. He excells in narration, and for the most
part displays his mere story with skill. But he is not a poet of
high imagination; he is like a Flemish painter, in whose
delineations objects appear as they do in nature, have the same
force and truth, and produce the same effect upon the spectator.
But Shakspeare is beyond this; &shy; he always by metaphors and
figures involves in the thing considered a universe of past and
possible experiences; he mingles earth, sea and air, gives a soul
to every thing, and at the same time that he inspires human
feelings, adds a dignity in his images to human nature
itself:&shy; <br>


<blockquote>Full many a glorious morning have I seen<br>
 Flatter the mountain tops with sovereign eye;<br>
 Kissing with golden face the meadows green,<br>
 Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchymy, &amp;c.<br>
<br>
 (33rd Sonnet.)</blockquote>

<br>
 <i>Note</i>. &shy; Have I not over-rated Gifford's edition of
Massinger? &shy; Not, &shy; if I have, as but just is, main
reference to the restitution of the text; but yes, perhaps, if I
were talking of the notes. These are more often wrong than right.
In the <i>Maid of Honour</i>, Act i. sc. 5. Astutio describes
Fulgentio as "A gentleman, yet no lord." Gifford supposes a
transposition of the press for "No gentleman, yet a lord." But
this would have no connection with what follows; and we have only
to recollect that "lord" means a lord of lands, to see that the
after lines are explanatory. He is a man of high birth, but no
landed property; &shy; as to the former, he is a distant branch
of the blood royal; &shy; as to the latter, his whole rent lies
in a narrow compass, the king's ear! In the same scene the text
stands: <br>
<blockquote><i>Bert</i>. No! they are useful<br>
 For your <i>imitation;</i> &shy; I remember you, &amp;c.;
&shy;</blockquote>

<br>
and Gifford condemns Mason's conjecture of 'initiation' as void
of meaning and harmony. Now my ear deceives me if 'initiation' be
not the right word. In fact, 'imitation' is utterly impertinent
to all that follows. Bertoldo tells Antonio that he had been
initiated in the manners suited to the court by two or three
sacred beauties, and that a similar experience would be equally
useful for his initiation into the camp. Not a word of his
imitation. Besides, I say the rhythm requires 'initiation,' and
is lame as the verse now stands. .<br>

<h3><a name="section42">Lecture VIII. <i>Don Quixote</i>.
Cervantes.</a></h3>

<p>Born at Madrid, 1547; &shy; Shakspeare, 1564; both put off
mortality on the same day, the 23rd of April, 1616, &shy; the one
in the sixty-ninth, the other in the fifty-second, year of his
life. The resemblance in their physiognomies is striking, but
with a predominance of acuteness in Cervantes, and of reflection
in Shakspeare, which is the specific difference between the
Spanish and English characters of mind.<br>
<br>
<b>I.</b>  The nature and eminence of Symbolical writing;
&shy;<br>
<br>
<b>II.</b>  Madness, and its different sorts, (considered without
pretension to medical science); &shy;<br>
<br>
To each of these, or at least to my own notions respecting them,
I must devote a few words of explanation, in order to render the
after critique on Don Quixote, the master work of Cervantes' and
his country's genius easily and throughout intelligible. This is
not the least valuable, though it may most often be felt by us
both as the heaviest and least entertaining portion of these
critical disquisitions: for without it, I must have foregone one
at least of the two appropriate objects of a Lecture, that of
interesting you during its delivery, and of leaving behind in
your minds the germs of after-thought, and the materials for
future enjoyment. To have been assured by several of my
intelligent auditors that they have reperused <i>Hamlet</i> or
<i>Othello</i> with increased satisfaction in consequence of the
new points of view in which I had placed those characters &shy;
is the highest compliment I could receive or desire; and should
the address of this evening open out a new source of pleasure, or
enlarge the former in your perusal of <i>Don Quixote</i>, it will
compensate for the failure of any personal or temporary
object.<br>
<br>
<br>
 <b>I.</b>  The Symbolical cannot, perhaps, be better defined in
distinction from the Allegorical, than that it is always itself a
part of that, of the whole of which it is the representative.
&shy; "Here comes a sail," &shy; (that is, a ship) is a
symbolical expression. "Behold our lion!" when we speak of some
gallant soldier, is allegorical. Of most importance to our
present subject is this point, that the latter (the allegory)
cannot be other than spoken consciously; &shy; whereas in the
former (the symbol) it is very possible that the general truth
represented may be working unconsciously in the writer's mind
during the construction of the symbol; &shy; and it proves itself
by being produced out of his own mind, &shy; as the Don Quixote
out of the perfectly sane mind of Cervantes, and not by outward
observation, or historically. The advantage of symbolical writing
over allegory is, that it presumes no disjunction of faculties,
but simple predominance.<br>
<br>
<br>
 <b>II.</b>  Madness may be divided as &shy;<br>
<br>
<b>1.</b>  hypochondriasis; or, the man is out of his senses.<br>
<br>
<b>2.</b>  derangement of the understanding; or, the man is out
of his wits.<br>
<br>
<b> </b> loss of reason.<br>
<br>
<b>4.</b>  frenzy, or derangement of the sensations.<br>
<br>
<a name="fpr"></a>Cervantes's own preface to <i>Don Quixote</i>
is a perfect model of the gentle, every where intelligible, irony
in the best essays of the <i>Tatler</i> and the <i>Spectator</i>.
Equally natural and easy, Cervantes is more spirited than
Addison; whilst he blends with the terseness of Swift, an
exquisite flow and music of style, and above all, contrasts with
the latter by the sweet temper of a superior mind, which saw the
follies of mankind, and was even at the moment suffering severely
under hard mistreatment; <a href="#fp">1</a> and yet seems every
where to have but one thought as the undersong &shy; "Brethren!
with all your faults I love you still!" &shy; or as a mother that
chides the child she loves, with one hand holds up the rod, and
with the other wipes off each tear as it drops!<br>
<br>
Don Quixote was neither fettered to the earth by want, nor holden
in its embraces by wealth; &shy; of which, with the temperance
natural to his country, as a Spaniard, he had both far too
little, and somewhat too much, to be under any necessity of
thinking about it. His age too, fifty, may be well supposed to
prevent his mind from being tempted out of itself by any of the
lower passions; &shy; while his habits, as a very early riser and
a keen sportsman, were such as kept his spare body in serviceable
subjection to his will, and yet by the play of hope that
accompanies pursuit, not only permitted, but assisted, his fancy
in shaping what it would. Nor must we omit his meagerness and
entire featureliness, face and frame, which Cervantes gives us at
once: "It is said that his surname was <i>Quixada</i> or
<i>Quesada,</i>" &amp;c. &shy; even in this trifle showing an
exquisite judgment; &shy; just once insinuating the association
of <i>lantern-jaws</i> into the reader's mind, yet not retaining
it obtrusively like the names in old farces and in the
<i>Pilgrim's Progress,</i> &shy; but taking for the regular
appellative one which had the no meaning of a proper name in real
life, and which yet was capable of recalling a number of very
different, but all pertinent, recollections, as old armour, the
precious metals hidden in the ore, &amp;c. Don Quixote's leanness and
featureliness are happy exponents of the excess of the formative
or imaginative in him, contrasted with Sancho's plump rotundity,
and recipiency of external impression.<br>
<br>
He has no knowledge of the sciences or scientific arts which give
to the meanest portions of matter an intellectual interest, and
which enable the mind to decypher in the world of the senses the
invisible agency &shy; that alone, of which the world's phenomena
are the effects and manifestations, &shy; and thus, as in a
mirror, to contemplate its own reflex, its life in the powers,
its imagination in the symbolic forms, its moral instincts in the
final causes, and its reason in the laws of material nature: but
&shy; estranged from all the motives to observation from
self-interest &shy; the persons that surround him too few and too
familiar to enter into any connection with his thoughts, or to
require any adaptation of his conduct to their particular
characters or relations to himself &shy; his judgment lies
fallow, with nothing to excite, nothing to employ it. Yet, &shy;
and here is the point, where genius even of the most perfect
kind, allotted but to few in the course of many ages, does not
preclude the necessity in part, and in part counterbalance the
craving by sanity of judgment, without which genius either cannot
be, or cannot at least manifest itself, &shy; the dependency of
our nature asks for some confirmation from without, though it be
only from the shadows of other men's fictions.<br>
<br>
Too uninformed, and with too narrow a sphere of power and
opportunity to rise into the scientific artist, or to be himself
a patron of art, and with too deep a principle and too much
innocence to become a mere projector, Don Quixote has recourse to
romances:&shy;<br>
</p>

<blockquote>His curiosity and extravagant fondness herein arrived
at that pitch, that he sold many acres of arable land to purchase
books of knight-errantry, and carried home all he could lay hands
on of that kind! (C.I.)</blockquote>

<br>
 The more remote these romances were from the language of common
life, the more akin on that very account were they to the
shapeless dreams and strivings of his own mind; &shy; a mind,
which possessed not the highest order of genius which lives in an
atmosphere of power over mankind, but that minor kind which, in
its restlessness, seeks for a vivid representative of its own
wishes, and substitutes the movements of that objective puppet
for an exercise of actual power in and by itself. The more wild
and improbable these romances were, the more were they akin to
his will, which had been in the habit of acting as an unlimited
monarch over the creations of his fancy! Hence observe how the
startling of the remaining common sense, like a glimmering before
its death, in the notice of the impossible-improbable of Don
Belianis, is dismissed by Don Quixote as impertinent:&shy; <br>
 <a name="fqr"></a><a name="frr"></a>

<blockquote><i>He had some doubt</i> <a href="#fq">2</a> as to
the dreadful wounds which Don Belianis gave and received: for he
imagined, that notwithstanding the most expert surgeons had cured
him, his face and whole body must still be full of seams and
scars. <i>Nevertheless</i> <a href="#fr">3</a> he commended in
his author the concluding his book with a promise of that
unfinishable adventure! (C. 1.)</blockquote>

<br>
 Hence also his first intention to turn author; but who, with
such a restless struggle within him, could content himself with
writing in a remote village among apathists and ignorants? During
his colloquies with the village priest and the barber surgeon, in
which the fervour of critical controversy feeds the passion and
gives reality to its object &shy; what more natural than that the
mental striving should become an eddy? &shy; madness may perhaps
be denned as the circling in a stream which should be progressive
and adaptive: Don Quixote grows at length to be a man out of his
wits; his understanding is deranged; and hence without the least
deviation from the truth of nature, without losing the least
trait of personal individuality, he becomes a substantial living
allegory, or personification of the reason and the moral sense,
divested of the judgment and the understanding. Sancho is the
converse. He is the common sense without reason or imagination;
and Cervantes not only shows the excellence and power of reason
in, Don Quixote, but in both him and Sancho the mischiefs
resulting from a severance of the two main constituents of sound
intellectual and moral action. Put him and his master together,
and they form a perfect intellect; but they are separated and
without cement; and hence each having a need of the other for its
own completeness, each has at times a mastery over the other. For
the common sense, although it may see the practical
inapplicability of the dictates of the imagination or abstract
reason, yet cannot help submitting to them. These two characters
possess the world, alternately and interchangeably the cheater
and the cheated. To impersonate them, and to combine the
permanent with the individual, is one of the highest creations of
genius, and has been achieved by Cervantes and Shakspeare, almost
alone.<br>
<br>
Observations on particular passages,

<blockquote>(B. I. c. 1.)  But not altogether approving of his
having broken it to pieces with so much ease, to secure himself
from the like danger for the future, he made it over again,
fencing it with small bars of iron within, in such a manner,
<i>that he rested satisfied of its strength; and without caring
to make a fresh experiment on it, he approved and looked upon it
as a most excellent helmet.</i></blockquote>

His not trying his improved scull-cap is an exquisite trait of
human character, founded on the oppugnancy of the soul in such a
state to any disturbance by doubt of its own broodings. Even the
long deliberation about his horse's name is full of meaning;
&shy; for in these day-dreams the greater part of the history
passes and is carried on in words, which look forward to other
words as what will be said of them.

<blockquote>(<i>Ib</i>)   Near the place where he lived, there
dwelt a very comely country lass, with whom he had formerly been
in love; though, as it is supposed, she never knew it, nor
troubled herself about it.</blockquote>

The nascent love for the country lass, but without any attempt at
utterance, or an opportunity of knowing her, except as the hint
&shy; the <img src="images/ColLitRemGk2.gif" width="80" height="35" alt=
"Greek: oti esti"> &shy; of the inward imagination, is happily
conceived in both parts; &shy; first, as confirmative of the
shrinking back of the mind on itself, and its dread of having a
cherished image destroyed by its own judgment; and secondly, as
showing how necessarily love is the passion of novels. Novels are
to love as fairy tales to dreams. I never knew but two men of
taste and feeling who could not understand why I was delighted
with the <i>Arabian Nights' Tales</i>, and they were likewise the
only persons in my knowledge who scarcely remembered having ever
dreamed. Magic and war &shy; itself a magic &shy; are the
day-dreams of childhood; love is the day-dream of youth and early
manhood.

<blockquote>(C. 2.)  "Scarcely had ruddy Phoebus spread the
golden tresses of his beauteous hair over the face of the wide
and spacious earth; and scarcely had the little painted birds,
with the sweet and mellifluous harmony of their forked tongues,
saluted the approach of rosy Aurora, who, quitting the soft couch
of her jealous husband, disclosed herself to mortals through the
gates of the Mauchegan horizon; when the renowned Don Quixote,"
&amp;c.</blockquote>

How happily already is the abstraction from the senses, from
observation, and the consequent confusion of the judgment, marked
in this description! The knight is describing objects immediate
to his senses and sensations without borrowing a single trait
from either. Would it be difficult to find parallel descriptions
in Dryden's plays and in those of his successors?<br>
<br>
(C. 3.) The host is here happily conceived as one who from his
past life as a sharper, was capable of entering into and
humouring the knight, and so perfectly in character, that he
precludes a considerable source of improbability in the future
narrative, by enforcing upon Don Quixote the necessity of taking
money with him.

<blockquote>(C. 3.)  "Ho, there, whoever thou art, rash knight,
that approachest to touch the arms of the most valorous
adventurer that ever girded sword," &amp;c.</blockquote>

Don Quixote's high eulogiums on himself &shy; "the most valorous
adventurer!" &shy; but it is not himself that he has before him,
but the idol of his imagination, the imaginary being whom he is
acting. And this, that it is entirely a third person, excuses his
heart from the otherwise inevitable charge of selfish vanity; and
so by madness itself he preserves our esteem, and renders those
actions natural by which he, the first person, deserves it.<br>
<br>
(C. 4.) Andres and his master. The manner in which Don Quixote
redressed this wrong, is a picture of the true revolutionary
passion in its first honest state, while it is yet only a
bewilderment of the understanding. You have a benevolence
limitless in its prayers, which are in fact aspirations towards
omnipotence; but between it and beneficence the bridge of
judgment &shy; that is, of measurement of personal power &shy;
intervenes, and must be passed. Otherwise you will be bruised by
the leap into the chasm, or be drowned in the revolutionary
river, and drag others with you to the same fate.<br>
<br>
(C. 4.) Merchants of Toledo.

<blockquote>When they were come so near as to be seen and heard,
Don Quixote raised his voice, and with arrogant air cried out:
"Let the whole world stand; if the whole world does not confess
that there is not in the whole world a damsel more beautiful
than," &amp;c.</blockquote>

Now mark the presumption which follows the self-complacency of
the last act! That was an honest attempt to redress a real wrong;
this is an arbitrary determination to enforce a Brissotine or
Rousseau's ideal on all his fellow creatures.

<blockquote>Let the whole world stand!<br>
<br>
 'If there had been any experience in proof of the excellence of
our code, where would be our superiority in this enlightened
age?'<br>
<br>
<a name="fsr"></a> "No! the business is that without seeing her,
you believe, confess, affirm, swear, and maintain it; <i>and if
not, I challenge you all to battle.</i>" <a href=
"#fs">4</a></blockquote>

Next see the persecution and fury excited by opposition however
moderate! The only words listened to are those, that without
their context and their conditionals, and transformed into
positive assertions, might give some shadow of excuse for the
violence shown! This rich story ends, to the compassion of the
men in their senses, in a sound rib-roasting of the idealist by
the muleteer, the mob. And happy for thee, poor knight! that the
mob were against thee! For had they been with thee, by the change
of the moon and of them, thy head would have been off.<br>
<br>
(C. 5.) first part &shy; The idealist recollects the causes that
had been accessary to the reverse and attempts to remove them
&shy; too late. He is beaten and disgraced.<br>
<br>
(C. 6.) This chapter on Don Quixote's library proves that the
author did not wish to destroy the romances, but to cause them to
be read as romances &shy; that is, for their merits as poetry.

<blockquote>(C. 7.)  Among other things, Don Quixote told him, he
should dispose himself to go with him willingly; &shy; for some
time or other such an adventure might present, that an island
might be won, in the turn of a hand, and he be left governor
thereof.</blockquote>

At length the promises of the imaginative reason begin to act on
the plump, sensual, honest common sense accomplice, &shy; but
unhappily not in the same person, and without the <i>copula</i>
of the judgment, &shy; in hopes of the substantial good things,
of which the former contemplated only the glory and the colours.

<blockquote>(C. 7.)  Sancho Panza went riding upon his ass, like
any patriarch, with his wallet and leathern bottle, and with a
vehement desire to find himself governor of the island which his
master had promised him.</blockquote>

The first relief from regular labour is so pleasant to poor
Sancho!

<blockquote>(C. 8.)  "I no gentleman! I swear by the great God,
thou liest, as I am a Christian. Biscainer by land, gentleman by
sea, gentleman for the devil, and thou liest: look then if thou
hast any thing else to say."</blockquote>

This Biscainer is an excellent image of the prejudices and
bigotry provoked by the idealism of a speculator. This story
happily detects the trick which our imagination plays in the
description of single combats: only change the preconception of
the magnificence of the combatants, and all is gone.

<blockquote>(B. II. c. 2.)   "Be pleased, my lord Don Quixote, to
bestow upon me the government of that island," &amp;c.</blockquote>

Sancho's eagerness for his government, the nascent lust of actual
democracy, or isocracy!

<blockquote>(C. 2.)   "But tell me, on your life, have you ever
seen a more valorous knight than I, upon the whole face of the
known earth? Have you read in story of any other, who has, or
ever had, more bravery in assailing, more breath in holding out,
more dexterity in wounding, or more address in giving a fall?"
&shy; "The truth is," answered Sancho, "that I never read any
history at all; for I can neither read nor write; but what I dare
affirm is, that I never served a bolder master," &amp;c.</blockquote>

<a name="ftr"></a>This appeal to Sancho, and Sancho's answer are
exquisitely humorous. It is impossible not to think of the French
bulletins and proclamations. Remark the necessity under which we
are of being sympathized with, fly as high into abstraction as we
may, and how constantly the imagination is recalled to the ground
of our common humanity! And note a little further on, the
knight's easy vaunting of his balsam, and his quietly deferring
the making and application of it.

<blockquote>(C. 3.)  "Happy times and happy ages," &amp;c. <a href=
"#ft">5</a></blockquote>

Note the rhythm of this, and the admirable beauty and wisdom of
the thoughts in themselves, but the total want of judgment in Don
Quixote's addressing them to such an audience.<br>
<br>
(B. III. c. 3.) Don Quixote's balsam, and the vomiting and
consequent relief; an excellent hit at <i>panacea nostrums,</i>
which cure the patient by his being himself cured of the medicine
by revolting nature.

<blockquote>"Peace! and have patience; the day will come,"
&amp;c.</blockquote>

The perpetual promises of the imagination!

<blockquote>"Your Worship," said Sancho, "would make a better
preacher than knight errant!"</blockquote>

Exactly so. This is the true moral. <br>
(C. 6.) The uncommon beauty of the description in the
commencement of this chapter. In truth, the whole of it seems to
put all nature in its heights and its humiliations, before
us.<br>
<br>
(Ib.) Sancho's story of the goats:

<blockquote>"Make account, he carried them all over," said Don
Quixote, "and do not be going and coming in this manner; for at
this rate, you will not have done carrying them over in a
twelvemonth." "How many are passed already?" said Sancho,
&amp;c.</blockquote>

<a name="fur"></a>Observe the happy contrast between the
all-generalizing mind of the mad knight, and Sancho's
all-particularizing memory. How admirable a symbol of the
dependence of all <i>copula</i> on the higher powers of the mind,
with the single exception of the succession in time and the
accidental relations of space. Men of mere common sense have no
theory or means of making one fact more important or prominent
than the rest; if they lose one link, all is lost. Compare Mrs.
Quickly and the Tapster. <a href="#fu">6</a> And note also
Sancho's good heart, when his master is about to leave him. Don
Quixote's conduct upon discovering the fulling-hammers, proves he
was meant to be in his senses. Nothing can be better conceived
than his fit of passion at Sancho's laughing, and his sophism of
self-justification by the courage he had shown.<br>
<br>
Sancho is by this time cured, through experience, as far as his
own errors are concerned; yet still is he lured on by the
unconquerable awe of his master's superiority, even when he is
cheating him.<br>
<br>
(C. 8.) The adventure of the Galley-slaves. I think this is the
only passage of moment in which Cervantes slips the mask of his
hero, and speaks for himself.

<blockquote>Don Quixote desired to have it, and bade him take the
money, and keep it for himself. Sancho kissed his hands for the
favour, &amp;c.</blockquote>

Observe Sancho's eagerness to avail himself of the permission of
his master, who, in the war sports of knight-errantry, had,
without any selfish dishonesty, overlooked the <i>meum</i> and
<i>tuum.</i> Sancho's selfishness is modified by his involuntary
goodness of heart, and Don Quixote's flighty goodness is debased
by the involuntary or unconscious selfishness of his vanity and
self-applause.<br>
<br>
(C. 10.) Cardenio is the madman of passion, who meets and easily
overthrows for the moment the madman of imagination. And note the
contagion of madness of any kind, upon Don Quixote's interruption
of Cardenio's story.<br>
<br>
(C. 11.) Perhaps the best specimen of Sancho's proverbializing is
this:

<blockquote>"And I (Don Q.) say again, they lie, and will lie two
hundred times more, all who say, or think her so." "I neither
say, nor think so," answered Sancho: "let those who say it, eat
the lie, and swallow it with their bread: whether they were
guilty or no, they have given an account to God before now: I
come from my vineyard, I know nothing; I am no friend to
inquiring into other men's lives; <i>for</i> he that buys and
lies shall find the lie left in his purse behind; <i>besides,</i>
naked was I born, and naked I remain; I neither win nor lose; if
they were guilty, what is that to me? Many think to find bacon,
where there is not so much as a pin to hang it on: <i>but</i> who
can hedge in the cuckoo? <i>Especially,</i> do they spare God
himself?"</blockquote>

<blockquote>(<i>Ib.</i>)  "And it is no great matter, if it be in
another hand; for by what I remember, Dulcinea can neither write
nor read," &amp;c.</blockquote>

(P. II. B. III. c. 9.) Sancho's account of what he had seen on
Clavileno is a counterpart in his style to Don Quixote's
adventures in the cave of Montesinos. This last is the only
impeachment of the knight's moral character; Cervantes just gives
one instance of the veracity failing before the strong cravings
of the imagination for something real and external; the picture
would not have been complete without this; and yet it is so well
managed, that the reader has no unpleasant sense of Don Quixote
having told a lie. It is evident that he hardly knows whether it
was a dream or not; and goes to the enchanter to inquire the real
nature of the adventure.<br>

<h3>Summary on Cervantes</h3>

<br>
A Castilian of refined manners; a gentleman, true to religion,
and true to honour.<br>
<br>
A scholar and a soldier, and fought under the banners of Don John
of Austria, at Lepanto, lost his arm and was captured.<br>
<br>
Endured slavery not only with fortitude, but with mirth; and by
the superiority of nature, mastered and overawed his barbarian
owner.<br>
<br>
Finally ransomed, he resumed his native destiny, the awful task
of achieving fame; and for that reason died poor and a prisoner,
while nobles and kings over their goblets of gold gave relish to
their pleasures by the charms of his divine genius. He was the
inventor of novels for the Spaniards, and in his <i>Persilis and
Sigismunda</i>, the English may find the germ of their
<i>Robinson Crusoe</i>.<br>
<br>
The world was a drama to him. His own thoughts, in spite of
poverty and sickness, perpetuated for him the feelings of youth.
He painted only what he knew and had looked into, but he knew and
had looked into much indeed; and his imagination was ever at hand
to adapt and modify the world of his experience. Of delicious
love he fabled, yet with stainless virtue. <br>

<h3><a name="section43">Lecture IX &shy; On the distinctions of
the witty, the droll, the odd and the humourous; the nature and
constituents of humour; &shy; Rabelais &shy; Swift &shy;
Sterne.</a></h3>

<p><b>I.</b>  Perhaps the most important of our intellectual
operations are those of detecting the difference in similar, and
the identity in dissimilar, things. Out of the latter operation
it is that wit arises; and it, generically regarded, consists in
presenting thoughts or images in an unusual connection with each
other, for the purpose of exciting pleasure by the surprise. This
connection may be real; and there is in fact a scientific wit;
though where the object, consciously entertained, is truth, and
not amusement, we commonly give it some higher name. But in wit
popularly understood, the connection may be, and for the most
part is, apparent only, and transitory; and this connection may
be by thoughts, or by words, or by images. The first is our
Butler's especial eminence; the second, Voltaire's; the third,
which we oftener call fancy, constitutes the larger and more
peculiar part of the wit of Shakspeare. You can scarcely turn to
a single speech of Falstaff's without finding instances of it.
Nor does wit always cease to deserve the name by being transient,
or incapable of analysis. I may add that the wit of thoughts
belongs eminently to the Italians, that of words to the French,
and that of images to the English.<br>
<br>
<b>II.</b>  Where the laughable is its own end, and neither
inference, nor moral is intended, or where at least the writer
would wish it so to appear, there arises what we call drollery.
The pure, unmixed, ludicrous or laughable belongs exclusively to
the understanding, and must be presented under the form of the
senses; it lies within the spheres of the eye and the ear, and
hence is allied to the fancy. It does not appertain to the reason
or the moral sense, and accordingly is alien to the imagination.
I think Aristotle has already excellently defined the
<i>laughable</i>, <img src="images/ColLitRemGk3.gif" width="103" height=
"35" alt="Greek: tho geloion"> , as consisting of, or depending
on, what is out of its proper time and place, yet without danger
or pain. Here the <i>impropriety</i> &shy; <img src=
"ColLitRemGk4.gif" width="96" height="29" alt=
"Greek: tho ahtapon"> &shy; is the positive qualification; the
<i>dangerlessness</i> &shy; <img src="images/ColLitRemGk5.gif" width=
"125" height="32" alt="Greek: tho akindunon"> &shy; the negative.
Neither the understanding without an object of the senses, as for
example, a mere notional error, or idiocy; &shy; nor any external
object, unless attributed to the understanding, can produce the
poetically laughable. Nay, even in ridiculous positions of the
body laughed at by the vulgar, there is a subtle personification
always going on, which acts on the, perhaps, unconscious mind of
the spectator as a symbol of intellectual character. And hence
arises the imperfect and awkward effect of comic stories of
animals; because although the understanding is satisfied in them,
the senses are not. Hence too, it is, that the true ludicrous is
its own end. When serious satire commences, or satire that is
felt as serious, however comically drest, free and genuine
laughter ceases; it becomes sardonic. This you experience in
reading Young, and also not unfrequently in Butler. The true
comic is the blossom of the nettle.<br>
<br>
<b>III.</b>  When words or images are placed in unusual
juxta-position rather than connection, and are so placed merely
because the juxta-position is unusual &shy; we have the odd or
the grotesque; the occasional use of which in the minor ornaments
of architecture, is an interesting problem for a student in the
psychology of the Fine Arts.<br>
<br>
<b>IV.</b>  In the simply laughable there is a mere disproportion
between a definite act and a definite purpose or end, or a
disproportion of the end itself to the rank or circumstances of
the definite person; but humour is of more difficult description.
I must try to define it in the first place by its points of
diversity from the former species. Humour does not, like the
different kinds of wit, which is impersonal, consist wholly in
the understanding and the senses. No combination of thoughts,
words, or images will of itself constitute humour, unless some
peculiarity of individual temperament and character be indicated
thereby, as the cause of the same. Compare the comedies of
Congreve with the Falstaff in <i>Henry IV</i>. or with Sterne's
Corporal Trim, Uncle Toby, and Mr. Shandy, or with some of
Steele's charming papers in the <i>Tatler</i>, and you will feel
the difference better than I can express it. Thus again, (to take
an instance from the different works of the same writer), in
Smollett's Strap, his Lieutenant Bowling, his Morgan the honest
Welshman, and his Matthew Bramble, we have exquisite humour,
&shy; while in his Peregrine Pickle we find an abundance of
drollery, which too often degenerates into mere oddity; in short,
we feel that a number of things are put together to counterfeit
humour, but that there is no growth from within. <a name=
"fvr"></a>And this indeed is the origin of the word, derived from
the humoral pathology, and excellently described by Ben
Jonson:</p>

<blockquote>So in every human body,<br>
 The choler, melancholy, phlegm, and blood,<br>
 By reason that they flow continually<br>
 In some one part, and are not continent,<br>
 Receive the name of humours. Now thus far<br>
 It may, by metaphor, apply itself<br>
 Unto the general disposition:<br>
 As when some one peculiar quality<br>
 Doth so possess a man, that it doth draw<br>
 All his effects, his spirits, and his powers,<br>
 In their confluctions, all to run one way,<br>
 This may be truly said to be a humour. <a href=
"#fv">1</a></blockquote>

Hence we may explain the congeniality of humour with pathos, so
exquisite in Sterne and Smollett, and hence also the tender
feeling which we always have for, and associate with, the humours
or hobby-horses of a man. First, we respect a humourist, because
absence of interested motive is the ground-work of the character,
although the imagination of an interest may exist in the
individual himself, as if a remarkably simple-hearted man should
pride himself on his knowledge of the world, and how well he can
manage it:&shy; and secondly, there always is in a genuine humour
an acknowledgement of the hollowness and farce of the world, and
its disproportion to the godlike within us. And it follows
immediately from this, that whenever particular acts have
reference to particular selfish motives, the humourous bursts
into the indignant and abhorring; whilst all follies not selfish
are pardoned or palliated. The danger of this habit, in respect
of pure morality, is strongly exemplified in Sterne.<br>
<br>
This would be enough, and indeed less than this has passed, for a
sufficient account of humour, if we did not recollect that not
every predominance of character, even where not precluded by the
moral sense, as in criminal dispositions, constitutes what we
mean by a humourist, or the presentation of its produce, humour.
What then is it? Is it manifold? Or is there some one humorific
point common to all that can be called humourous? &shy; I am not
prepared to answer this fully, even if my time permitted; but I
think there is; &shy; and that it consists in a certain reference
to the general and the universal, by which the finite great is
brought into identity with the little, or the little with the
finite great, so as to make both nothing in comparison with the
infinite. The little is made great, and the great little, in
order to destroy both; because all is equal in contrast with the
infinite. <a name="fwr"></a>"It is not without reason, brother
Toby, that learned men write dialogues on long noses." <a href=
"#fw">2</a> I would suggest, therefore, that whenever a finite is
contemplated in reference to the infinite, whether consciously or
unconsciously, humour essentially arises. In the highest humour,
at least, there is always a reference to, and a connection with,
some general power not finite, in the form of some finite
ridiculously disproportionate in our feelings to that of which it
is, nevertheless, the representative, or by which it is to be
displayed. Humourous writers, therefore, as Sterne in particular,
delight, after much preparation, to end in nothing, or in a
direct contradiction.<br>
<br>
That there is some truth in this definition, or origination of
humour, is evident; for you cannot conceive a humourous man who
does not give some disproportionate generality, or even a
universality to his hobby-horse, as is the case with Mr. Shandy;
or at least there is an absence of any interest but what arises
from the humour itself, as in my Uncle Toby, and it is the idea
of the soul, of its undefined capacity and dignity, that gives
the sting to any absorption of it by any one pursuit, and this
not in respect of the humourist as a mere member of society for a
particular, however mistaken, interest, but as a man.<br>
<br>
The English humour is the most thoughtful, the Spanish the most
etherial &shy; the most ideal &shy; of modern literature. Amongst
the classic ancients there was little or no humour in the
foregoing sense of the term. Socrates, or Plato under his name,
gives some notion of humour in the Banquet, when he argues that
tragedy and comedy rest upon the same ground. But humour properly
took its rise in the middle ages; and the Devil, the Vice of the
mysteries, incorporates the modern humour in its elements. It is
a spirit measured by disproportionate finites. The Devil is not,
indeed, perfectly humourous; but that is only because he is the
extreme of all humour.<br>

<h3><a name="fxr"></a>Rabelais  <a href="#fx">1</a></h3>

<br>
Born at Chinon, 1483-4. &shy;Died 1553.<br>
<br>
One cannot help regretting that no friend of Rabelais, (and
surely friends he must have had), has left an authentic account
of him. His buffoonery was not merely Brutus' rough stick, which
contained a rod of gold; it was necessary as an amulet against
the monks and bigots. Beyond a doubt, he was among the deepest as
well as boldest thinkers of his age. Never was a more plausible,
and seldom, I am persuaded, a less appropriate line than the
thousand times quoted,

<blockquote>Rabelais laughing in his easy chair
&shy;</blockquote>

of Mr. Pope. The caricature of his filth and zanyism proves how
fully he both knew and felt the danger in which he stood. I could
write a treatise in proof and praise of the morality and moral
elevation of Rabelais' work which would make the church stare and
the conventicle groan, and yet should be the truth and nothing
but the truth. I class Rabelais with the creative minds of the
world, Shakspeare, Dante, Cervantes, &amp;c.<br>
<br>
All Rabelais' personages are phantasmagoric allegories, but
Panurge above all. He is throughout the <img src=
"ColLitRemGk6.gif" width="91" height="25" alt="Greek: panourgia">
&shy; the wisdom, that is, the cunning of the human animal, &shy;
the understanding, as the faculty of means to purposes without
ultimate ends, in the most comprehensive sense, and including
art, sensuous fancy, and all the passions of the understanding.
It is impossible to read Rabelais without an admiration mixed
with wonder at the depth and extent of his learning, his
multifarious knowledge, and original observation beyond what
books could in that age have supplied him with.

<blockquote>(B. III. c. 9.)  How Panurge asketh counsel of
Pantagruel, whether he should marry, yea or no.</blockquote>

Note this incomparable chapter. Pantagruel stands for the reason
as contradistinguished from the understanding and choice, that
is, from Panurge; and the humour consists in the latter asking
advice of the former on a subject in which the reason can only
give the inevitable conclusion, the syllogistic <i>ergo</i>, from
the premisses provided by the understanding itself, which puts
each case so as of necessity to predetermine the verdict thereon.
This chapter, independently of the allegory, is an exquisite
satire on the spirit in which people commonly ask advice. <a
name="fx"></a><span style="color: #FF0000;">Footnote 1</span>: No
note remains of that part of this Lecture which treated of
Rabelais. This seems, therefore, a convenient place for the
reception of some remarks written by Mr. C. in Mr. Gillman's copy
of Rabelais, about the year 1825. See <i>Table Talk</i>, vol. i.

<h3>Swift  <a href="#fy">1</a></h3>

<br>
Born in Dublin, 1667. &shy;Died 1745.<br>
<br>
In Swift's writings there is a false misanthropy grounded upon an
exclusive contemplation of the vices and follies of mankind, and
this misanthropic tone is also disfigured or brutalized by his
obtrusion of physical dirt and coarseness. I think <i>Gulliver's
Travels</i> the great work of Swift. In the voyages to Lilliput
and Brobdingnag he displays the littleness and moral
contemptibility of human nature; in that to the Houyhnhnms he
represents the disgusting spectacle of man with the understanding
only, without the reason or the moral feeling, and in his horse
he gives the misanthropic ideal of man &shy; that is, a being
virtuous from rule and duty, but untouched by the principle of
love.<br>

<h3>Sterne</h3>

<br>
Born at Clonmel, 1713. &shy;Died 1768.<br>
<br>
With regard to Sterne, and the charge of licentiousness which
presses so seriously upon his character as a writer, I would
remark that there is a sort of knowingness, the wit of which
depends &shy; 1st, on the modesty it gives pain to; or, 2dly, on
the innocence and innocent ignorance over which it triumphs; or,
3dly, on a certain oscillation in the individual's own mind
between the remaining good and the encroaching evil of his nature
&shy; a sort of dallying with the devil &shy; a fluxionary act of
combining courage and cowardice, as when a man snuffs a candle
with his fingers for the first time, or better still, perhaps,
like that trembling daring with which a child touches a hot tea
urn, because it has been forbidden; so that the mind has in its
own white and black angel the same or similar amusement, as may
be supposed to take place between an old debauchee and a prude,
&shy; she feeling resentment, on the one hand, from a prudential
anxiety to preserve appearances and have a character, and, on the
other, an inward sympathy with the enemy. We have only to suppose
society innocent, and then nine-tenths of this sort of wit would
be like a stone that falls in snow, making no sound because
exciting no resistance; the remainder rests on its being an
offence against the good manners of human nature itself.<br>
<br>
This source, unworthy as it is, may doubtless be combined with
wit, drollery, fancy, and even humour, and we have only to regret
the misalliance; but that the latter are quite distinct from the
former, may be made evident by abstracting in our imagination the
morality of the characters of Mr. Shandy, my Uncle Toby, and
Trim, which are all antagonists to this spurious sort of wit,
from the rest of Tristram Shandy, and by supposing, instead of
them, the presence of two or three callous debauchees. The result
will be pure disgust. Sterne cannot be too severely censured for
thus using the best dispositions of our nature as the panders and
condiments for the basest.<br>
<br>
The excellencies of Sterne consist &shy; <br>
<br>
<b>1.</b>  In bringing forward into distinct consciousness those
minutiae of thought and feeling which appear trifles, yet have an
importance for the moment, and which almost every man feels in
one way or other. Thus is produced the novelty of an individual
peculiarity, together with the interest of a something that
belongs to our common nature. In short, Sterne seizes happily on
those points, in which every man is more or less a humourist.
And, indeed, to be a little more subtle, the propensity to notice
these things does itself constitute the humourist, and the
superadded power of so presenting them to men in general gives us
the man of humour. Hence the difference of the man of humour, the
effect of whose portraits does not depend on the felt presence of
himself, as a humourist, as in the instances of Cervantes and
Shakspeare &shy; nay, of Rabelais too; and of the humourist, the
effect of whose works does very much depend on the sense of his
own oddity, as in Sterne's case, and perhaps Swift's; though
Swift again would require a separate classification.<br>
<br>
<b>2.</b>  In the traits of human nature, which so easily assume
a particular cast and colour from individual character. Hence
this excellence and the pathos connected with it quickly pass
into humour, and form the ground of it. See particularly the
beautiful passage, so well known, of Uncle Toby's catching and
liberating the fly:

<blockquote>"Go," &shy; says he, one day at dinner, to an
overgrown one which had buzzed about his nose, and tormented him
cruelly all dinner-time, and which, after infinite attempts, he
had caught at last, as it flew by him; &shy; "I'll not hurt
thee," says my Uncle Toby, rising from his chair, and going
across the room, with the fly in his hand, &shy; "I'll not hurt a
hair of thy head:&shy; Go," says he, lifting up the sash, and
opening his hand as he spoke, to let it escape; &shy; "go, poor
devil, get thee gone, why should I hurt thee? This world is
surely wide enough to hold both thee and me." (Vol. ii. ch.
12.)</blockquote>

Observe in this incident how individual character may be given by
the mere delicacy of presentation and elevation in degree of a
common good quality, humanity, which in itself would not be
characteristic at all.<br>
<br>
<b>3.</b>  In Mr. Shandy's character, &shy; the essence of which
is a craving for sympathy in exact proportion to the oddity and
unsympathizability of what he proposes; &shy; this coupled with
an instinctive desire to be at least disputed with, or rather
both in one, to dispute and yet to agree &shy; and holding as
worst of all &shy; to acquiesce without either resistance or
sympathy. This is charmingly, indeed, profoundly conceived, and
is psychologically and ethically true of all Mr. Shandies. Note,
too, how the contrasts of character, which are always either
balanced or remedied, increase the love between the brothers.<br>
<br>
<b>4.</b>  No writer is so happy as Sterne in the unexaggerated
and truly natural representation of that species of slander,
which consists in gossiping about our neighbours, as whetstones
of our moral discrimination; as if they were conscience-blocks
which we used in our apprenticeship, in order not to waste such
precious materials as our own consciences in the trimming and
shaping of ourselves by self-examination:&shy;

<blockquote>Alas o'day! &shy; had Mrs. Shandy (poor gentlewoman!)
had but her wish in going up to town just to lie in and come down
again; which, they say, she begged and prayed for upon her bare
knees, and which, in my opinion, considering the fortune which
Mr. Shandy got with her, was no such mighty matter to have
complied with, the lady and her babe might both of them have been
alive at this hour. (Vol. i. c. 18.)</blockquote>

<b>5.</b>  When you have secured a man's likings and prejudices
in your favour, you may then safely appeal to his impartial
judgment. In the following passage not only is acute sense
shrouded in wit, but a life and a character are added which exalt
the whole into the dramatic:&shy;

<blockquote>"I see plainly, Sir, by your looks" (or as the case
happened) my father would say &shy; "that you do not heartily
subscribe to this opinion of mine &shy; which, to those," he
would add, "who have not carefully sifted it to the bottom, &shy;
I own has an air more of fancy than of solid reasoning in it; and
yet, my dear Sir, if I may presume to know your character, I am
morally assured, I should hazard little in stating a case to you,
not as a party in the dispute, but as a judge, and trusting my
appeal upon it to your good sense and candid disquisition in this
matter; you are a person free from as many narrow prejudices of
education as most men; and, if I may presume to penetrate farther
into you, of a liberality of genius above bearing down an
opinion, merely because it wants friends. Your son, &shy; your
dear son, &shy; from whose sweet and open temper you have so much
to expect, &shy; your Billy, Sir! &shy; would you, for the world,
have called him JUDAS? Would you, my dear Sir," he would say,
laying his hand upon your breast, with the genteelest address,
&shy; and in that soft and irresistible <i>piano</i> of voice
which the nature of the <i>argumentum ad hominem</i> absolutely
requires, &shy; "Would you, Sir, if a <i>Jew</i> of a godfather
had proposed the name for your child, and offered you his purse
along with it, would you have consented to such a desecration of
him? O my God!" he would say, looking up, "if I know your temper
rightly, Sir, you are incapable of it; &shy; you would have
trampled upon the offer; &shy; you would have thrown the
temptation at the tempter's head with abhorrence. Your greatness
of mind in this action, which I admire, with that generous
contempt of money, which you show me in the whole transaction, is
really noble; &shy; and what renders it more so, is the principle
of it; &shy; the workings of a parent's love upon the truth and
conviction of this very hypothesis, namely, that were your son
called Judas, &shy; the sordid and treacherous idea, so
inseparable from the name, would have accompanied him through
life like his shadow, and in the end made a miser and a rascal of
him, in spite, Sir, of your example." (Vol. i. c.
19.)</blockquote>

<b>6.</b>  There is great physiognomic tact in Sterne. See it
particularly displayed in his description of Dr. Slop,
accompanied with all that happiest use of drapery and attitude,
which at once give reality by individualizing and vividness by
unusual, yet probable, combinations:&shy;

<blockquote>Imagine to yourself a little squat, uncourtly figure
of a Doctor Slop, of about four feet and a half perpendicular
height, with a breadth of back, and a sesquipedality of belly,
which might have done honour to a serjeant in the horseguards.
... Imagine such a one; &shy; for such I say, were the outlines
of Dr. Slop's figure, coming slowly along, foot by foot, waddling
through the dirt upon the <i>vertebr&aelig;</i> of a little
diminutive pony, of a pretty colour &shy; but of strength, &shy;
alack! scarce able to have made an amble of it, under such a
fardel, had the roads been in an ambling condition; &shy; they
were not. Imagine to yourself Obadiah mounted upon a strong
monster of a coach-horse, pricked into a full gallop, and making
all practicable speed the adverse way. (Vol. ii. c.
9.)</blockquote>

<br>
 <b>7.</b>  I think there is more humour in the single remark,
which I have quoted before &shy; "Learned men, brother Toby,
don't write dialogues upon long noses for nothing!" &shy; than in
the whole Slawkenburghian tale that follows, which is mere oddity
interspersed with drollery.<br>
<br>
<b>8.</b>  Note Sterne's assertion of, and faith in, a moral good
in the characters of Trim, Toby, &amp;c. as contrasted with the cold
scepticism of motives which is the stamp of the Jacobin spirit.
(Vol. v. c. 9.)<br>
<br>
<b>9.</b>  You must bear in mind, in order to do justice to
Rabelais and Sterne, that by right of humoristic universality
each part is essentially a whole in itself. Hence the digressive
spirit is not mere wantonness, but in fact the very form and
vehicle of their genius. The connection, such as was needed, is
given by the continuity of the characters.<br>
<br>
<br>
Instances of different forms of wit, taken largely:<br>
<br>
<b>1.</b>  Why are you reading romances at your age?" &shy; "Why,
I used to be fond of history, but I have given it up, &shy; it
was so grossly improbable."<br>
<br>
<b>2.</b>  "Pray, sir, do it! &shy; although you have promised
me."<br>
<br>
<b>3.</b>  The Spartan mother's &shy;

<blockquote>"Return with, or on, thy shield."<br>
<br>
 "My sword is too short!" &shy; "Take a step
forwarder."</blockquote>

<b>4.</b>  The Gasconade:&shy;

<blockquote>"I believe you, Sir! but you will excuse my repeating
it on account of my provincial accent."</blockquote>

<br>
<b>5.</b>  Pasquil on Pope Urban, who had employed a committee to
rip up the old errors of his predecessors.<br>
<br>
Some one placed a pair of spurs on the heels of the statue of St.
Peter, and a label from the opposite statue of St. Paul, on the
same bridge; &shy;

<blockquote><i>St. Paul.</i> "Whither then are you bound?"<br>
<br>
 <i>St. Peter.</i> "I apprehend danger here;- they'll soon call
me in question for denying my Master."<br>
<br>
 <i>St. Paul.</i> "Nay, then, I had better be off too; for
they'll question me for having persecuted the Christians, before
my conversion."</blockquote>

<br>
 <b>6.</b>  Speaking of the small German potentates, I dictated
the phrase, &shy; <i>officious for equivalents.</i> This my
amanuensis wrote, &shy; <i>fishing for elephants;</i> &shy;
which, as I observed at the time, was a sort of Noah's angling,
that could hardly have occurred, except at the commencement of
the Deluge.

<br>
 The wit of Donne, the wit of Butler, the wit of Pope, the wit of
Congreve, the wit of Sheridan &shy; how many disparate things are
here expressed by one and the same word, Wit! &shy;
Wonder-exciting vigour, intenseness and peculiarity of thought,
using at will the almost boundless stores of a capacious memory,
and exercised on subjects, where we have no right to expect it
&shy; this is the wit of Donne! The four others I am just in the
mood to describe and inter-distinguish; &shy; what a pity that
the marginal space will not let me!<br>
<blockquote>My face in thine eye, thine in mine appears,<br>
 And true plain hearts do in the faces rest;<br>
 Where can we &shy; find two fitter hemispheres<br>

<br>

<br>
 The sense is; &shy; Our mutual loves may in many respects be
fitly compared to corresponding hemispheres; but as no simile
squares (<i>nihil simile est idem</i>), so here the simile fails,
for there is nothing in our loves that corresponds to the cold
north, or the declining west, which in two hemispheres must
necessarily be supposed. But an ellipse of such length will
scarcely rescue the line from the charge of nonsense or a bull.

<br>
 This use of the word <i>mine</i> specifically for mines of gold,
silver, or precious stones, is, I believe, peculiar to Donne.<br>

<h3>Dante</h3>

<br>
Born at Florence, 1265. &shy;Died, 1321.<br>
<br>
As I remarked in a former Lecture on a different subject (for
subjects the most diverse in literature have still their
tangents), the Gothic character, and its good and evil fruits,
appeared less in Italy than in any other part of European
Christendom. There was accordingly much less romance, as that
word is commonly understood; or, perhaps, more truly stated,
there was romance instead of chivalry. In Italy, an earlier
imitation of, and a more evident and intentional blending with,
the Latin literature took place than elsewhere. The operation of
the feudal system, too, was incalculably weaker, of that singular
chain of independent interdependents, the principle of which was
a confederacy for the preservation of individual, consistently
with general, freedom. In short, Italy, in the time of Dante, was
an afterbirth of eldest Greece, a renewal or a reflex of the old
Italy under its kings and first Roman consuls, a net-work of free
little republics, with the same domestic feuds, civil wars, and
party spirit, &shy; the same vices and virtues produced on a
similarly narrow theatre, &shy; the existing state of things
being, as in all small democracies, under the working and
direction of certain individuals, to whose will even the laws
were swayed; &shy; whilst at the same time the singular spectacle
was exhibited amidst all this confusion of the flourishing of
commerce, and the protection and encouragement of letters and
arts. Never was the commercial spirit so well reconciled to the
nobler principles of social polity as in Florence. It tended
there to union and permanence and elevation, &shy; not as the
overbalance of it in England is now doing, to dislocation, change
and moral degradation. The intensest patriotism reigned in these
communities, but confined and attached exclusively to the small
locality of the patriot's birth and residence; whereas in the
true Gothic feudalism, country was nothing but the preservation
of personal independence. But then, on the other hand, as a
counterbalance to these disuniting elements, there was in Dante's
Italy, as in Greece, a much greater uniformity of religion common
to all than amongst the northern nations.<br>
<br>
Upon these hints the history of the republican aeras of ancient
Greece and modern Italy ought to be written. There are three
kinds or stages of historic narrative:<br>
<b>1.</b>  that of the annalist or chronicler, who deals merely
in facts and events arranged in order of time, having no
principle of selection, no plan of arrangement, and whose work
properly constitutes a supplement to the poetical writings of
romance or heroic legends:<br>
<b>2.</b>  that of the writer who takes his stand on some moral
point, and selects a series of events for the express purpose of
illustrating it, and in whose hands the narrative of the selected
events is modified by the principle of selection; &shy; as
Thucydides, whose object was to describe the evils of democratic
and aristocratic partizanships; &shy; or Polybius, whose design
was to show the social benefits resulting from the triumph and
grandeur of Rome, in public institutions and military discipline;
&shy; or Tacitus, whose secret aim was to exhibit the pressure
and corruptions of despotism; &shy; in all which writers and
others like them, the ground-object of the historian colours with
artificial lights the facts which he relates:<br>
<b>3.</b>  and which in idea is the grandest-the most truly,
founded in philosophy &shy; there is the Herodotean history,
which is not composed with reference to any particular causes,
but attempts to describe human nature itself on a great scale as
a portion of the drama of providence, the free will of man
resisting the destiny of events, &shy; for the individuals often
succeeding against it, but for the race always yielding to it,
and in the resistance itself invariably affording means towards
the completion of the ultimate result. Mitford's history is a
good and useful work; but in his zeal against democratic
government, Mitford forgot, or never saw, that ancient Greece was
not, nor ought ever to be considered, a permanent thing, but that
it existed, in the disposition of providence, as a proclaimer of
ideal truths, and that everlasting proclamation being made, that
its functions were naturally at an end.<br>
<br>
However, in the height of such a state of society in Italy, Dante
was born and flourished; and was himself eminently a picture of
the age in which he lived. But of more importance even than this,
to a right understanding of Dante, is the consideration that the
scholastic philosophy was then at its acme even in itself; but
more especially in Italy, where it never prevailed so exclusively
as northward of the Alps. It is impossible to understand the
genius of Dante, and difficult to understand his poem, without
some knowledge of the characters, studies, and writings of the
schoolmen of the twelfth, thirteenth, and fourteenth centuries.
For Dante was the living link between religion and philosophy; he
philosophized the religion and christianized the philosophy of
Italy; and, in this poetic union of religion and philosophy, he
became the ground of transition into the mixed Platonism and
Aristotelianism of the Schools, under which, by numerous minute
articles of faith and ceremony, Christianity became a craft of
hair-splitting, and was ultimately degraded into a complete
<i>fetisch</i> worship, divorced from philosophy, and made up of
a faith without thought, and a credulity directed by passion.
Afterwards, indeed, philosophy revived under condition of
defending this very superstition; and, in so doing, it
necessarily led the way to its subversion, and that in exact
proportion to the influence of the philosophic schools. Hence it
did its work most completely in Germany, then in England, next in
France, then in Spain, least of all in Italy. We must, therefore,
take the poetry of Dante as christianized, but without the
further Gothic accession of proper chivalry. It was at a somewhat
later period, that the importations from the East, through the
Venetian commerce and the crusading armaments, exercised a
peculiarly strong influence on Italy.<br>
<br>
In studying Dante, therefore, we must consider carefully the
differences produced, first, by allegory being substituted for
polytheism; and secondly and mainly, by the opposition of
Christianity to the spirit of pagan Greece, which receiving the
very names of its gods from Egypt, soon deprived them of all that
was universal. The Greeks changed the ideas into finites, and
these finites into <i>anthropomorphi,</i> or forms of men. Hence
their religion, their poetry, nay, their very pictures, became
statuesque. With them the form was the end. The reverse of this
was the natural effect of Christianity; in which finites, even
the human form, must, in order to satisfy the mind, be brought
into connexion with, and be in fact symbolical of, the infinite;
and must be considered in some enduring, however shadowy and
indistinct, point of view, as the vehicle or representative of
moral truth.<br>
<br>
Hence resulted two great effects; a combination of poetry with
doctrine, and, by turning the mind inward on its own essence
instead of letting it act only on its outward circumstances and
communities, a combination of poetry with sentiment. And it is
this inwardness or subjectivity, which principally and most
fundamentally distinguishes all the classic from all the modern
poetry. Compare the passage in the <i>Iliad</i> (Z. vi. 119-236.)
in which Diomed and Glaucus change arms, &shy; <br>


<blockquote><img src="images/ColLitRemGk7.gif" width="369" height="32"
alt=
"Greek (transliterated): Cheiras t'allilon labetin kai pistosanto">
<br>
<br>
 They took each other by the hand, and pledged friendship
&shy;</blockquote>

<br>
 with the scene in <i>Ariosto</i> (Orlando Furioso, c. i. st.
20-22.), where Rinaldo and Ferrauto fight and afterwards make it
up:&shy; <br>
<blockquote>Al Pagan la proposta non dispiacque:<br>
 Cos&igrave; fu differita la tenzone;<br>
 E tal tregua tra lor subito nacque,<br>
 S&igrave; l' odio e l' ira va in obliv&iuml;one,<br>
 Che 'l Pagano al partir dalle fresche acque<br>
 Non lasci&ograve; a piede il buon figliuol d' Amone:<br>
 Con preghi invita, e al fin lo toglie in groppa,<br>
 E per l' orme d' Angelica galoppa.</blockquote>

<br>
 Here Homer would have left it. But the Christian poet has his
own feelings to express, and goes on:&shy; <br>


<blockquote>Oh gran bont&agrave; de' cavalieri antiqui!<br>
 Eran rivali, eran di f&egrave; diversi,<br>
 E si sent&iacute;an degli aspri colpi iniqui<br>
 Per tutta la persona anco dolersi;<br>
 E pur per selve oscure e calli obbliqui<br>
 Insieme van senza sospetto aversi!</blockquote>

<br>
 And here you will observe, that the reaction of Ariosto's own
feelings on the image or act is more fore-grounded (to use a
painter's phrase) than the image or act itself.<br>
<br>
The two different modes in which the imagination is acted on by
the ancient and modern poetry, may be illustrated by the parallel
effects caused by the contemplation of the Greek or Roman-Greek
architecture, compared with the Gothic. In the Pantheon, the
whole is perceived in a perceived harmony with the parts which
compose it; and generally you will remember that where the parts
preserve any distinct individuality, there simple beauty, or
beauty simply, arises; but where the parts melt undistinguished
into the whole, there majestic beauty, or majesty, is the result.
In York Minster, the parts, the grotesques, are in themselves
very sharply distinct and separate, and this distinction and
separation of the parts is counterbalanced only by the multitude
and variety of those parts, by which the attention is bewildered;
&shy; whilst the whole, or that there is a whole produced, is
altogether a feeling in which the several thousand distinct
impressions lose themselves as in a universal solvent. Hence in a
Gothic cathedral, as in a prospect from a mountain's top, there
is, indeed, a unity, an awful oneness; &shy; but it is, because
all distinction evades the eye. And just such is the distinction
between the <i>Antigone</i> of Sophocles and the <i>Hamlet</i> of
Shakespeare.<br>
<br>
The <i>Divina Commedia</i> is a system of moral, political, and
theological truths, with arbitrary personal exemplifications,
which are not, in my opinion, allegorical. I do not even feel
convinced that the punishments in the Inferno are strictly
allegorical. I rather take them to have been in Dante's mind
<i>quasi</i>-allegorical, or conceived in analogy to pure
allegory.<br>
<br>
I have said, that a combination of poetry with doctrines, is one
of the characteristics of the Christian muse; but I think Dante
has not succeeded in effecting this combination nearly so well as
Milton.<br>
<br>
This comparative failure of Dante, as also some other
peculiarities of his mind, in <i>malam partem,</i> must be
immediately attributed to the state of North Italy in his time,
which is vividly represented in Dante's life; a state of intense
democratical partizanship, in which an exaggerated importance was
attached to individuals, and which whilst it afforded a vast
field for the intellect, opened also a boundless arena for the
passions, and in which envy, jealousy, hatred, and other
malignant feelings, could and did assume the form of patriotism,
even to the individual's own conscience.<br>
<br>
<a name="fabr"></a>All this common, and, as it were, natural
partizanship, was aggravated arid coloured by the Guelf and
Ghibelline factions; and, in part explanation of Dante's
adherence to the latter, you must particularly remark, that the
Pope had recently territorialized his authority to a great
extent, and that this increase of territorial power in the
church, was by no means the same beneficial movement for the
citizens of free republics, as the parallel advance in other
countries was for those who groaned as vassals under the
oppression of the circumjacent baronial castles. <a href=
"#fab">1</a><br>
<br>
By way of preparation to a satisfactory perusal of the <i>Divina
Commedia</i>, I will now proceed to state what I consider to be
Dante's chief excellences as a poet. And I begin with:<br>
<br>
<br>
 <b>I.</b>  Style &shy; the vividness, logical connexion,
strength and energy of which cannot be surpassed. In this I think
Dante superior to Milton; and his style is accordingly more
imitable than Milton's, and does to this day exercise a greater
influence on the literature of his country. You cannot read Dante
without feeling a gush of manliness of thought within you. Dante
was very sensible of his own excellence in this particular, and
speaks of poets as guardians of the vast armory of language,
which is the intermediate something between matter and
spirit:&shy; <br>


<blockquote>Or se' tu quel Virgilio, e quella fonte,<br>
Che spande di parlar s&igrave; largo fiume?<br>
Risposi lui con vergognosa fronte.<br>
 O degli altri poeti onore e lume,<br>
Vagliami 'l lungo studio e 'l grande amore,<br>
Che m' han fatto cercar lo tuo volume.<br>
 Tu se' lo mio maestro, e 'l mio autore:<br>
<i>Tu se' solo colui, da cu' io tolsi<br>
Lo bello stile, che m' ha fatto onore.</i><br>
 (<i>Inf</i>. c. 1. v. 79.)<br>
<br>
 "And art thou then that Virgil, that well-spring,<br>
 From which such copious floods of eloquence<br>
 Have issued?" I, with front abash'd, replied:<br>
 "Glory and light of all the tuneful train!<br>
 May it avail me, that I long with zeal<br>
 Have sought thy volume, and with love immense<br>
 Have conn'd it o'er. My master, thou, and guide!<br>
 <i>Thou he from whom I have alone deriv'd<br>
 That style, which for its beauty into fame<br>
 Exalts me."</i><br>
 (Cary. [his translation. html <i>Ed.</i>])</blockquote>

<br>
 Indeed there was a passion and a miracle of words in the twelfth
and thirteenth centuries, after the long slumber of language in
barbarism, which gave an almost romantic character, a virtuous
quality and power, to what was read in a book, independently of
the thoughts or images contained in it. This feeling is very
often perceptible in Dante.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<b>II.</b>  The Images in Dante are not only taken from obvious
nature, and are all intelligible to all, but are ever conjoined
with the universal feeling received from nature, and therefore
affect the general feelings of all men. And in this respect,
Dante's excellence is very great, and may be contrasted with the
idiosyncracies of some meritorious modern poets, who attempt an
eruditeness, the result of particular feelings. Consider the
simplicity, I may say plainness, of the following simile, and how
differently we should in all probability deal with it at the
present day:<br>


<blockquote><a name="facr"></a>Quale i fioretti dal notturno
gelo<br>
Chinati e chiusi, poi che 'l sol gl' imbianca,<br>
Si drizzan tutti aperti in loro stelo, &shy;<br>
 Fal mi fec' io di mia virtute stanca;<br>
 (<i>Inf.</i> c. 2. v. 127.)<br>
<br>
 As florets, by the frosty air of night<br>
 Bent down and clos'd, when day has blanch'd their leaves,<br>
 Rise all unfolded on their spiry stems, &shy;<br>
 So was my fainting vigour new restor'd.<br>
 (Cary. <a href="#fac">2</a>)</blockquote>

<br>
<br>
 <b>III.</b>  Consider the wonderful profoundness of the whole
third canto of the <i>Inferno</i>; and especially of the
inscription over Hell gate:

<blockquote>Per me si va, &amp;c. &shy;</blockquote>

which can only be explained by a meditation on the true nature of
religion; that is, &shy; reason <i>plus</i> the understanding. I
say profoundness rather than sublimity; for Dante does not so
much elevate your thoughts as send them down deeper. In this
canto all the images are distinct, and even vividly distinct; but
there is a total impression of infinity; the wholeness is not in
vision or conception, but in an inner feeling of totality, and
absolute being.<br>
<br>

<b>IV.</b>  In picturesqueness, Dante is beyond all other poets,
modern or ancient, and more in the stern style of Pindar, than of
any other. Michel Angelo is said to have made a design for every
page of the <i>Divina Commedia</i>. As superexcellent in this
respect, I would note the conclusion of the third canto of the
<i>Inferno</i>:<br>


<blockquote>Ed ecco verso noi venir per nave<br>
Un vecchio bianco per antico pelo<br>
Gridando: guai a voi anime prave: &amp;c. ...<br>
 (Ver. 82. &amp;c.)<br>
<br>
 And lo! toward us in a bark<br>
 Comes on an old man, hoary white with eld,<br>
 Crying, "Woe to you wicked spirits!" ...<br>
 (Cary.)<br>
<br>
Caron dimonio con occhi di bragia<br>
Loro accennando, tutte le raccoglie:<br>
Batte col remo qualunque s' adagia.<br>
 Come d' autunno si levan le foglie<br>
L' una appresso dell altra, infin che 'l ramo<br>
Rende alia terra tutte le sue spoglie;<br>
 Similemente il mal seme d' Adamo,<br>
Gittansi di quel lito ad una ad una<br>
Per cenni, com' augel per suo richiamo.<br>
 (Ver. 100, &amp;c.)<br>
<br>
 &shy; &shy; &shy; Charon, demoniac form,<br>
 With eyes of burning coal, collects them all,<br>
 Beck'ning, and each that lingers, with his oar<br>
 Strikes. As fall off the light autumnal leaves,<br>
 One still another following, till the bough<br>
 Strews all its honours on the earth beneath; &shy;<br>
 E'en in like manner Adam's evil brood<br>
 Cast themselves one by one down from the shore<br>
 Each at a beck, as falcon at his call.<br>
 (Cary.)</blockquote>

<br>
 And this passage, which I think admirably picturesque:<br>


<blockquote>Ma poco valse, che l' ale al sospetto<br>
Non potero avanzar: quegli and&ograve; sotto,<br>
E quei drizz&ograve;, volando, suso il petto.<br>
 Non altrimenti l' anitra di botto,<br>
Quando 'l falcon s' appressa, gi&ugrave; s' attuffa,<br>
Ed ei ritorna su crucciato e rotto.<br>
 Irato Calcabrina della buffa,<br>
Volando dietro gli tenne, invaghito,<br>
Che quei campasse, per aver la zuffa:<br>
 E come 'l barattier fu disparito,<br>
Cosi volse gli artigli al suo compagno,<br>
E fu con lui sovra 'l fosso ghermito.<br>
 Ma l' altro fu bene sparvier grifagno<br>
Ad artigliar ben lui, e amedue<br>
Cadder nel mezzo del bollente stagno.<br>
 Lo caldo sghermidor subito fue:<br>
Ma per&ograve; di levarsi era niente,<br>
Si aveano inviscate l' ale sue.<br>
 (<i>Infer.</i> c. xxii. ver. 127, &amp;c.)<br>
<br>
 But little it avail'd: terror outstripp'd<br>
 His following flight: the other plung'd beneath,<br>
 And he with upward pinion rais'd his breast:<br>
 E'en thus the water-fowl, when she perceives<br>
 The falcon near, dives instant down, while he<br>
 Enrag'd and spent retires. That mockery<br>
 In Calcabrina fury stirr'd, who flew<br>
 After him, with desire of strife inflam'd;<br>
 And, for the barterer had 'scap'd, so turn'd<br>
 His talons on his comrade. O'er the dyke<br>
 In grapple close they join'd; but th' other prov'd<br>
 A goshawk, able to rend well his foe;<br>
 And in the boiling lake both fell. The heat<br>
 Was umpire soon between them, but in vain<br>
 To lift themselves they strove, so fast were glued<br>
 Their pennons.<br>
 (Cary.)</blockquote>

<br>
<br>
 <b>V.</b>  Very closely connected with this picturesqueness, is
the topographic reality of Dante's journey through Hell. You
should note and dwell on this as one of his great charms, and
which gives a striking peculiarity to his poetic power. He thus
takes the thousand delusive forms of a nature worse than chaos,
having no reality but from the passions which they excite, and
compels them into the service of the permanent. Observe the
exceeding truth of these lines:<br>


<blockquote>Noi ricidemmo 'l cerchio all' altra riva,<br>
Sovr' una fonte che bolle, e riversa,<br>
Per un fossato che da lei diriva.<br>
 L' acqua era buja molto pi&ugrave; che persa:<br>
E noi in compagnia dell' onde bige<br>
Entrammo gi&ugrave; per una via diversa.<br>
 Una palude fa, ch' ha nome Stige,<br>
Questo tristo ruscel, quando &egrave; disceso<br>
Al pi&egrave; delle maligne piagge grige.<br>
 Ed io che di mirar mi stava inteso, &shy;<br>
Vidi genti fangose in quel pantano<br>
Ignude tutte, e con sembiante offeso.<br>
 Questi si percotean non pur con mano,<br>
Ma con la testa, e col petto, e co' piedi,<br>
Troncandosi co' denti a brano a brano. ...<br>
<br>
 Cos&igrave; girammo della lorda pozza<br>
Grand' arco tra la ripa secca e 'l mezzo,<br>
Con gli occhi volti a chi del fango ingozza:<br>
 <i>Venimmo appi&ugrave; d' una torre al dassezzo.</i><br>
 (C. vii. ver. 100 and 127.)<br>
<br>
 &shy; &shy; We the circle cross'd<br>
 To the next steep, arriving at a well,<br>
 That boiling pours itself down to a foss<br>
 Sluic'd from its source. Far murkier was the wave<br>
 Than sablest grain: and we in company<br>
 Of th' inky waters, journeying by their side,<br>
 Enter'd, though by a different track, beneath.<br>
 Into a lake, the Stygian nam'd, expands<br>
 The dismal stream, when it hath reach'd the foot<br>
 Of the grey wither'd cliffs. Intent I stood<br>
 To gaze, and in the marish sunk, descried<br>
 A miry tribe, all naked, and with looks<br>
 Betok'ning rage. They with their hands alone<br>
 Struck not, but with the head, the breast, the feet,<br>
 Cutting each other piecemeal with their fangs. ...<br>
<br>
 &shy; &shy; Our route<br>
 Thus compass'd, we a segment widely stretch'd<br>
 Between the dry embankment and the cove<br>
 Of the loath'd pool, turning meanwhile our eyes<br>
 Downward on those who gulp'd its muddy lees;<br>
 <i>Nor stopp'd, till to a tower's low base we came.</i><br>
 (Cary.)</blockquote>

<br>
<br>
 <b>VI.</b>  For Dante's power, &shy; his absolute mastery over,
although rare exhibition of, the pathetic, I can do no more than
refer to the passages on Francesca di Rimini (<i>Infer</i>. C. v.
ver. 73 to the end.) and on Ugolino, (<i>Infer</i>. C. xxxiii.
ver. 1. to 75.) They are so well known, and rightly so admired,
that it would be pedantry to analyze their composition; but you
will note that the first is the pathos of passion, the second
that of affection; and yet even in the first, you seem to
perceive that the lovers have sacrificed their passion to the
cherishing of a deep and rememberable impression.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<b>VII.</b>  As to going into the endless subtle beauties of
Dante, that is impossible; but I cannot help citing the first
triplet of the 29th canto of the <i>Inferno</i>:<br>


<blockquote>La molta gente e le diverse piaghe<br>
 Avean le luci mie s&igrave; inebriate,<br>
 Che dello stare a piangere eran vaghe.<br>
<br>
 So were mine eyes inebriate with the view<br>
 Of the vast multitude, whom various wounds<br>
 Disfigur'd, that they long'd to stay and weep.<br>
<br>
(Cary.)</blockquote>

<br>
 Nor have I now room for any specific comparison of Dante with
Milton. But if I had, I would institute it upon the ground of the
last canto of the <i>Inferno</i> from the 1st to the 69th line,
and from the 106th to the end. And in this comparison I should
notice Dante's occasional fault of becoming grotesque from being
too graphic without imagination; as in his Lucifer compared with
Milton's Satan. Indeed he is sometimes horrible rather than
terrible, &shy; falling into the <img src="images/ColLitRemGk8.gif"

"ColLitRemGk9.gif" width="72" height="26" alt="deinon"> of

other cases, you may perceive that the faults of great authors
are generally excellencies carried to an excess.<br>

<h3>Milton</h3>

<br>
Born in London, 1608. &shy;Died, 1674<br>
<br>
If we divide the period from the accession of Elizabeth to the
Protectorate of Cromwell into two unequal portions, the first
ending with the death of James I. the other comprehending the
reign of Charles and the brief glories of the Republic, we are
forcibly struck with a difference in the character of the
illustrious actors, by whom each period is rendered severally
memorable. Or rather, the difference in the characters of the
great men in each period, leads us to make this division.<br>
<br>
Eminent as the intellectual powers were that were displayed in
both; yet in the number of great men, in the various sorts of
excellence, and not merely in the variety but almost diversity of
talents united in the same individual, the age of Charles falls
short of its predecessor; and the stars of the Parliament, keen
as their radiance was, in fulness and richness of lustre, yield
to the constellation at the court of Elizabeth; &shy; which can
only be paralleled by Greece in her brightest moment, when the
titles of the poet, the philosopher, the historian, the statesman
and the general not seldom formed a garland round the same head,
as in the instances of our Sidneys and Raleighs. But then, on the
other hand, there was a vehemence of will, an enthusiasm of
principle, a depth and an earnestness of spirit, which the charms
of individual fame and personal aggrandisement could not pacify,
&shy; an aspiration after reality, permanence, and general good,
&shy; in short, a moral grandeur in the latter period, with which
the low intrigues, Machiavellic maxims, and selfish and servile
ambition of the former, stand in painful contrast.<br>
<br>
The causes of this it belongs not to the present occasion to
detail at length; but a mere allusion to the quick succession of
revolutions in religion, breeding a political indifference in the
mass of men to religion itself, the enormous increase of the
royal power in consequence of the humiliation of the nobility and
the clergy &shy; the transference of the papal authority to the
crown, &shy; the unfixed state of Elizabeth's own opinions, whose
inclinations were as popish as her interests were protestant
&shy; the controversial extravagance and practical imbecility of
her successor &shy; will help to explain the former period; and
the persecutions that had given a life and soul-interest to the
disputes so imprudently fostered by James, &shy; the ardour of a
conscious increase of power in the commons, and the greater
austerity of manners and maxims, the natural product and most
formidable weapon of religious disputation, not merely in
conjunction, but in closest combination, with newly awakened
political and republican zeal, these perhaps account for the
character of the latter aera.<br>
<br>
In the close of the former period, and during the bloom of the
latter, the poet Milton was educated and formed; and he survived
the latter, and all the fond hopes and aspirations which had been
its life; and so in evil days, standing as the representative of
the combined excellence of both periods, he produced the
<i>Paradise Lost</i> as by an after-throe of nature. "There are
some persons (observes a divine, a contemporary of Milton's) of
whom the grace of God takes early hold, and the good spirit
inhabiting them, carries them on in an even constancy through
innocence into virtue, their Christianity bearing equal date with
their manhood, and reason and religion, like warp and woof,
running together, make up one web of a wise and exemplary life.
This (he adds) is a most happy case, wherever it happens; for,
besides that there is no sweeter or more lovely thing on earth
than the early buds of piety, which drew from our Saviour signal
affection to the beloved disciple, it is better to have no wound
than to experience the most sovereign balsam, which, if it work a
cure, yet usually leaves a scar behind." Although it was and is
my intention to defer the consideration of Milton's own character
to the conclusion of this Lecture, yet I could not prevail on
myself to approach the <i>Paradise Lost</i> without impressing on
your minds the conditions under which such a work was in fact
producible at all, the original genius having been assumed as the
immediate agent and efficient cause; and these conditions I find
in the character of the times and in his own character. The age
in which the foundations of his mind were laid, was congenial to
it as one golden era of profound erudition and individual genius;
&shy; that in which the superstructure was carried up, was no
less favourable to it by a sternness of discipline and a show of
self-control, highly flattering to the imaginative dignity of an
heir of fame, and which won Milton over from the dear-loved
delights of academic groves and cathedral aisles to the
anti-prelatic party. It acted on him, too, no doubt, and modified
his studies by a characteristic controversial spirit, (his
presentation of God is tinted with it) &shy; a spirit not less
busy indeed in political than in theological and ecclesiastical
dispute, but carrying on the former almost always, more or less,
in the guise of the latter. <a name="f3er"></a>And so far as
Pope's censure <a href="#f3e">1</a> of our poet, &shy; that he
makes God the Father a school divine &shy; is just, we must
attribute it to the character of his age, from which the men of
genius, who escaped, escaped by a worse disease, the licentious
indifference of a Frenchified court.<br>
<br>
Such was the <i>nidus</i> or soil, which constituted, in the
strict sense of the word, the circumstances of Milton's mind. In
his mind itself there were purity and piety absolute; an
imagination to which neither the past nor the present were
interesting, except as far as they called forth and enlivened the
great ideal, in which and for which he lived; a keen love of
truth, which, after many weary pursuits, found a harbour in a
sublime listening to the still voice in his own spirit, and as
keen a love of his country, which, after a disappointment still
more depressive, expanded and soared into a love of man as a
probationer of immortality. These were, these alone could be, the
conditions under which such a work as the <i>Paradise Lost</i>
could be conceived and accomplished. <a name="f3fr"></a>By a
life-long study Milton had known &shy; <br>


<blockquote>What was of use to know,<br>
 What best to say could say, to do had done.<br>
 His actions to his words agreed, his words<br>
 To his large heart gave utterance due, his heart<br>
 Contain'd of good, wise, fair, the perfect shape;</blockquote>

<br>
 and he left the imperishable total, as a bequest to the ages
coming, in the <i>Paradise Lost</i>. <a href="#f3f">2</a><br>
<br>
Difficult as I shall find it to turn over these leaves without
catching some passage, which would tempt me to stop, I propose to
consider, <br>
<b>1st</b>,  the general plan and arrangement of the work;<br>
<b>2ndly</b>,  the subject with its difficulties and
advantages;<br>
<b>3rdly</b>,  the poet's object, the spirit in the letter, the
<img src="images/ColLitRemGk10.gif" width="162" height="30" alt=
"enthumion en muthps"> , the true school-divinity; <br>
and <b>lastly</b>,  the characteristic excellencies of the poem,
in what they consist, and by what means they were produced.<br>
<br>
<br>
 <b>1.</b>  As to the plan and ordonnance of the Poem.<br>
<br>
 Compare it with the <i>Iliad</i>, many of the books of which
might change places without any injury to the thread of the
story. Indeed, I doubt the original existence of the <i>Iliad</i>
as one poem; it seems more probable that it was put together
about the time of the Pisistratidae. The <i>Iliad</i> &shy; and,
more or less, all epic poems, the subjects of which are taken
from history &shy; have no rounded conclusion; they remain, after
all, but single chapters from the volume of history, although
they are ornamental chapters. Consider the exquisite simplicity
of the <i>Paradise Lost</i>. It and it alone really possesses a
beginning, a middle, and an end; it has the totality of the poem
as distinguished from the <i>ab ovo</i> birth and parentage, or
straight line, of history.<br>
<br>
<br>
 <b>2.</b>  As to the subject.<br>
<br>
In Homer, the supposed importance of the subject, as the first
effort of confederated Greece, is an after-thought of the
critics; and the interest, such as it is, derived from the events
themselves, as distinguished from the manner of representing
them, is very languid to all but Greeks. It is a Greek poem. The
superiority of the <i>Paradise Lost</i> is obvious in this
respect, that the interest transcends the limits of a nation. But
we do not generally dwell on this excellence of the <i>Paradise
Lost</i>, because it seems attributable to Christianity itself;
&shy; yet in fact the interest is wider than Christendom, and
comprehends the Jewish and Mohammedan worlds; &shy; nay, still
further, inasmuch as it represents the origin of evil, and the
combat of evil and good, it contains matter of deep interest to
all mankind, as forming the basis of all religion, and the true
occasion of all philosophy whatsoever.<br>
<br>
The FALL of Man is the subject; Satan is the cause; man's
blissful state the immediate object of his enmity and attack; man
is warned by an angel who gives him an account of all that was
requisite to be known, to make the warning at once intelligible
and awful; then the temptation ensues, and the Fall; then the
immediate sensible consequence; then the consolation, wherein an
angel presents a vision of the history of men with the ultimate
triumph of the Redeemer. Nothing is touched in this vision but
what is of general interest in religion; any thing else would
have been improper.<br>
<br>
The inferiority of Klopstock's <i>Messiah</i> is inexpressible. I
admit the prerogative of poetic feeling, and poetic faith; but I
cannot suspend the judgment even for a moment. A poem may in one
sense be a dream, but it must be a waking dream. In Milton you
have a religious faith combined with the moral nature; it is an
efflux; you go along with it. In Klopstock there is a wilfulness;
he makes things so and so. The feigned speeches and events in the
<i>Messiah</i> shock us like falsehoods; but nothing of that sort
is felt in the <i>Paradise Lost</i>, in which no particulars, at
least very few indeed, are touched which can come into collision
or juxta-position with recorded matter.<br>
<br>
But notwithstanding the advantages in Milton's subject, there
were concomitant insuperable difficulties, and Milton has
exhibited marvellous skill in keeping most of them out of sight.
High poetry is the translation of reality into the ideal under
the predicament of succession of time only. The poet is an
historian, upon condition of moral power being the only force in
the universe. The very grandeur of his subject ministered a
difficulty to Milton. The statement of a being of high intellect,
warring against the supreme Being, seems to contradict the idea
of a supreme Being. Milton precludes our feeling this, as much as
possible, by keeping the peculiar attributes of divinity less in
sight, making them to a certain extent allegorical only. Again,
poetry implies the language of excitement; yet how to reconcile
such language with God? Hence Milton confines the poetic passion
in God's speeches to the language of scripture; and once only
allows the <i>passio vera,</i> or <i>quasi-humana</i> to appear,
in the passage, where the Father contemplates his own likeness in
the Son before the battle:&shy; <br>


<blockquote>Go then, thou Mightiest, in thy Father's might,<br>
 Ascend my chariot, guide the rapid wheels<br>
 That shake Heaven's basis, bring forth all my war,<br>
 My bow and thunder; my almighty arms<br>
 Gird on, and sword upon thy puissant thigh;<br>
 Pursue these sons of darkness, drive them out<br>
 From all Heaven's bounds into the utter deep:<br>
 There let them learn, as likes them, to despise<br>
 God and Messiah his anointed king.<br>
 (B. VI. v. 710.)</blockquote>

<br>
<br>
 <b>3.</b>  As to Milton's object:&shy; <br>
<br>
It was to justify the ways of God to man! The controversial
spirit observable in many parts of the poem, especially in God's
speeches, is immediately attributable to the great controversy of
that age, the origination of evil. The Arminians considered it a
mere calamity. The Calvinists took away all human will. Milton
asserted the will, but declared for the enslavement of the will
out of an act of the will itself. There are three powers in us,
which distinguish us from the beasts that perish;<br>
<b>1,</b>  reason; <br>
<b>2,</b>  the power of viewing universal truth;<br>
and <b>3,</b>  the power of contracting universal truth into
particulars. Religion is the will in the reason, and love in the
will.<br>
<br>
The character of Satan is pride and sensual indulgence, finding
in self the sole motive of action. It is the character so often
seen <i>in little</i> on the political stage. It exhibits all the
restlessness, temerity, and cunning which have marked the mighty
hunters of mankind from Nimrod to Napoleon. The common
fascination of men is, that these great men, as they are called,
must act from some great motive. Milton has carefully marked in
his Satan the intense selfishness, the alcohol of egotism, which
would rather reign in hell than serve in heaven. To place this
lust of self in opposition to denial of self or duty, and to show
what exertions it would make, and what pains endure to accomplish
its end, is Milton's particular object in the character of Satan.
But around this character he has thrown a singularity of daring,
a grandeur of sufferance, and a ruined splendour, which
constitute the very height of poetic sublimity.<br>
<br>
<br>
 <b>Lastly</b>, as to the execution:&shy; <br>
<br>
The language and versification of the <i>Paradise Lost</i> are
peculiar in being so much more necessarily correspondent to each
than those in any other poem or poet. The connexion of the
sentences and the position of the words are exquisitely
artificial; but the position is rather according to the logic of
passion or universal logic, than to the logic of grammar. Milton
attempted to make the English language obey the logic of passion
as perfectly as the Greek and Latin. Hence the occasional
harshness in the construction.<br>
<br>
Sublimity is the pre-eminent characteristic of the <i>Paradise
Lost</i>. It is not an arithmetical sublime like Klopstock's,
whose rule always is to treat what we might think large as
contemptibly small. Klopstock mistakes bigness for greatness.
There is a greatness arising from images of effort and daring,
and also from those of moral endurance; in Milton both are
united. The fallen angels are human passions, invested with a
dramatic reality.<br>
<br>
The apostrophe to light at the commencement of the third book is
particularly beautiful as an intermediate link between Hell and
Heaven; and observe, how the second and third book support the
subjective character of the poem. In all modern poetry in
Christendom there is an under consciousness of a sinful nature, a
fleeting away of external things, the mind or subject greater
than the object, the reflective character predominant. In the
<i>Paradise Lost</i> the sublimest parts are the revelations of
Milton's own mind, producing itself and evolving its own
greatness; and this is so truly so, that when that which is
merely entertaining for its objective beauty is introduced, it at
first seems a discord.<br>
<br>
In the description of Paradise itself you have Milton's sunny
side as a man; here his descriptive powers are exercised to the
utmost, and he draws deep upon his Italian resources. In the
description of Eve, and throughout this part of the poem, the
poet is predominant over the theologian. Dress is the symbol of
the Fall, but the mark of intellect; and the metaphysics of dress
are, the hiding what is not symbolic and displaying by
discrimination what is. The love of Adam and Eve in Paradise is
of the highest merit &shy; not phantomatic, and yet removed from
every thing degrading. It is the sentiment of one rational being
towards another made tender by a specific difference in that
which is essentially the same in both; it is a union of
opposites, a giving and receiving mutually of the permanent in
either, a completion of each in the other.<br>
<br>
Milton is not a picturesque, but a musical, poet; although he has
this merit that the object chosen by him for any particular
foreground always remains prominent to the end, enriched, but not
incumbered, by the opulence of descriptive details furnished by
an exhaustless imagination. I wish the <i>Paradise Lost</i> were
more carefully read and studied than I can see any ground for
believing it is, especially those parts which, from the habit of
always looking for a story in poetry, are scarcely read at all,
&shy; as for example, Adam's vision of future events in the llth
and l2th books. No one can rise from the perusal of this immortal
poem without a deep sense of the grandeur and the purity of
Milton's soul, or without feeling how susceptible of domestic
enjoyments he really was, notwithstanding the discomforts which
actually resulted from an apparently unhappy choice in marriage.
He was, as every truly great poet has ever been, a good man; but
finding it impossible to realize his own aspirations, either in
religion, or politics, or society, he gave up his heart to the
living spirit and light within him, and avenged himself on the
world by enriching it with this record of his own transcendant
ideal.<br>

<h3><a name="f3gr"></a>Notes on Milton  <a href="#f3g">1</a></h3>

<br>
(Hayley quotes the following passage:&shy; )<br>


<blockquote>"Time serves not now, and, perhaps, I might seem too
profuse to give any certain account of what the mind at home, in
the spacious circuits of her musing, hath liberty to propose to
herself, though of highest hope and hardest attempting; whether
that epic form, whereof the two poems of Homer, and those other
two of Virgil and Tasso, are a diffuse, and <i>the Book of
Job</i> a brief, model," p. 69.</blockquote>

<br>
 These latter words deserve particular notice. I do not doubt
that Milton intended his <i>Paradise Lost</i> as an epic of the
first class, and that the poetic dialogue of the <i>Book of
Job</i> was his model for the general scheme of his <i>Paradise
Regained</i>. Readers would not be disappointed in this latter
poem, if they proceeded to a perusal of it with a proper
preconception of the kind of interest intended to be excited in
that admirable work. In its kind it is the most perfect poem
extant, though its kind may be inferior in interest &shy; being
in its essence didactic &shy; to that other sort, in which
instruction is conveyed more effectively, because less directly,
in connection with stronger and more pleasurable emotions, and
thereby in a closer affinity with action. But might we not as
rationally object to an accomplished woman's conversing, however
agreeably, because it has happened that we have received a keener
pleasure from her singing to the harp? <a name="f3hr"></a><i>Si
genus sit probo et sapienti viro hand indignum, et si poema sit

<br>
 had breathed the spirit of Hayley's noble quotation rather than
the narrow bigotry of Gregory the Great. The passage is, indeed,
excellent, and is partially true; but partial truth is the worst
mode of conveying falsehood.<br>


<blockquote>(Hayley, p. 75.) "The sincerest friends of Milton may
here agree with Johnson, who speaks of <i>his controversial
merriment as disgusting."</i></blockquote>

<br>
 The man who reads a work meant for immediate effect on one age
with the notions and feelings of another, may be a refined
gentleman, but must be a sorry critic. He who possesses
imagination enough to live with his forefathers, and, leaving
comparative reflection for an after moment, to give himself up
during the first perusal to the feelings of a contemporary, if
not a partizan, will, I dare aver, rarely find any part of
Milton's prose works disgusting.<br>
<br>
(Hayley, p. 104. Hayley is speaking of the passage in Milton's
<i>Answer to Icon Basilice</i>, in which he accuses Charles of
taking his Prayer in captivity from Pamela's prayer in the 3rd
book of Sidney's <i>Arcadia</i>. The passage begins, &shy; <br>


<blockquote>"But this king, not content with that which, although
in a thing holy, is no holy theft, to attribute to his own making
other men's whole prayers, &amp;c. (Symmons' Ed. 1806, p.
407.))</blockquote>

<br>
 Assuredly, I regret that Milton should have written this
passage; and yet the adoption of a prayer from a romance on such
an occasion does not evince a delicate or deeply sincere mind. We
are the creatures of association. There are some excellent moral
and even serious lines in <i>Hudibras</i>; but what if a
clergyman should adorn his sermon with a quotation from that
poem! Would the abstract propriety of the verses leave him
"honourably acquitted?" The Christian baptism of a line in Virgil
is so far from being a parallel, that it is ridiculously
inappropriate, &shy; an absurdity as glaring as that of the
bigotted Puritans, who objected to some of the noblest and most
scriptural prayers ever dictated by wisdom and piety, simply
because the Roman Catholics had used them. <br>


<blockquote>(Hayley, p. 107.) "The ambition of Milton,"
&amp;c.</blockquote>

<br>


<blockquote>I do not approve the so frequent use of this word
relatively to Milton. Indeed the fondness for ingrafting a good
sense on the word "ambition," is not a Christian impulse in
general.</blockquote>

<br>


<blockquote>Hayley, p. 110. "Milton himself seems to have thought
it allowable in literary contention to vilify, &amp;c. the character
of an opponent; but surely this doctrine is unworthy,"
&amp;c.</blockquote>

<br>
 If ever it were allowable, in this ease it was especially so.
But these general observations, without meditation on the
particular times and the genius of the times, are most often as
unjust as they are always superficial.<br>
<br>
(Hayley, p. 133. Hayley is speaking of Milton's panegyric on
Cromwell's government:-)<br>


<blockquote>Besides, however Milton might and did regret the
immediate necessity, yet what alternative was there? Was it not
better that Cromwell should usurp power, to protect religious
freedom at least, than that the Presbyterians should usurp it to
introduce a religious persecution, &shy; extending the notion of
spiritual concerns so far as to leave no freedom even to a man's
bedchamber?</blockquote>

<br>
 (Hayley, p. 250. Hayley's conjectures on the origin of the
<i>Paradise Lost</i>:&shy; )<br>


<blockquote>If Milton borrowed a hint from any writer, it was
more probably from Strada's Prolusions, in which the Fall of the
Angels is pointed out as the noblest subject for a Christian
poet.[1] The more dissimilar the detailed images are, the more
likely it is that a great genius should catch the general
idea.</blockquote>

<br>
 (Hayl. p. 294. Extracts from the <i>Adamo</i> of Andreini:)<br>


<blockquote>"Lucifero. Che dal mio centre oscuro<br>
Mi chiama a rimirar cotanta luce?<br>
<br>
 Who from my dark abyss<br>
Calls me to gaze on this <i>excess of light?</i>"</blockquote>

<br>
 The words in italics are an unfair translation. They may suggest
that Milton really had read and did imitate this drama. The
original is 'in so great light.' Indeed the whole version is
affectedly and inaccurately Miltonic.<br>


<blockquote>(p Ib. v. 11.)<br>

<br>
 The reader of Milton must be always on his duty: he is
surrounded with sense; it rises in every line; every word is to
the purpose. There are no lazy intervals; all has been
considered, and demands and merits observation. If this be called
obscurity, let it be remembered that it is such an obscurity as
is a compliment to the reader; not that vicious obscurity, which
proceeds from a muddled head.<br>

<a name="f3jr">Lecture XI &shy;
Asiatic and Greek Mythologies &shy; Robinson Crusoe &shy; Use of
Works of Imagination in Education</a>
<a href="#f3j">1</a></h3>

<p>A confounding of God with Nature, and an incapacity of finding
unity in the manifold and infinity in the individual, &shy; these
are the origin of polytheism. The most perfect instance of this
kind of theism is that of early Greece; other nations seem to
have either transcended, or come short of, the old Hellenic
standard, &shy; a mythology in itself fundamentally allegorical,
and typical of the powers and functions of nature, but
subsequently mixed up with a deification of great men and
hero-worship, &shy; so that finally the original idea became
inextricably combined with the form and attributes of some
legendary individual. In Asia, probably from the greater unity of
the government and the still surviving influence of patriarchal
tradition, the idea of the unity of God, in a distorted
reflection of the Mosaic scheme, was much more generally
preserved; and accordingly all other super or ultra-human beings
could only be represented as ministers of, or rebels against, his
will. The Asiatic genii and fairies are, therefore, always
endowed with moral qualities, and distinguishable as malignant or
benevolent to man. It is this uniform attribution of fixed moral
qualities to the supernatural agents of eastern mythology that
particularly separates them from the divinities of old
Greece.<br>
<br>
Yet it is not altogether improbable that in the Samothracian or
Cabeiric mysteries the link between the Asiatic and Greek popular
schemes of mythology lay concealed. Of these mysteries there are
conflicting accounts, and, perhaps, there were variations of
doctrine in the lapse of ages and intercourse with other systems.
But, upon a review of all that is left to us on this subject in
the writings of the ancients, we may, I think, make out thus much
of an interesting fact, &shy; that <i>Cabiri</i>, impliedly at
least, meant <i>socii, complices,</i> having a hypostatic or
fundamental union with, or relation to, each other; that these
mysterious divinities were, ultimately at least, divided into a
higher and lower triad; that the lower triad, <i>primi quia
infimi,</i> consisted of the old Titanic deities or powers of
nature, under the obscure names of <i>Axieros, Axiokersos,</i>
and <i>Axiokersa,</i> representing symbolically different
modifications of animal desire or material action, such as
hunger, thirst, and fire, without consciousness; that the higher
triad, <i>ultimi quia superiores,</i> consisted of Jupiter,
(Pallas, or Apollo, or Bacchus, or Mercury, mystically called
<i>Cadmilos</i>) and Venus, representing, as before, the <img
src="images/ColLitRemGk11.gif" width="48" height="30" alt="Greek: nous">
or reason, the <img src="images/ColLitRemGk12.gif" width="65" height=
"33" alt="Greek: logos"> or word or communicative power, and the
<img src="images/ColLitRemGk13.gif" width="54" height="32" alt=
"Greek: eros"> or love;-that the <i>Cadmilos</i> or Mercury, the
manifested, communicated, or sent, appeared not only in his
proper person as second of the higher triad, but also as a
mediator between the higher and lower triad, and so there were
seven divinities; and, indeed, according to some authorities, it
might seem that the <i>Cadmilos</i> acted once as a mediator of
the higher, and once of the lower, triad, and that so there were
eight Cabeiric divinities. The lower or Titanic powers being
subdued, chaos ceased, and creation began in the reign of the
divinities of mind and love; but the chaotic gods still existed
in the abyss, and the notion of evoking them was the origin, the
idea, of the Greek necromancy.<br>
<br>
These mysteries, like all the others, were certainly in
connection with either the Phoenician or Egyptian systems,
perhaps with both. Hence the old Cabeiric powers were soon made
to answer to the corresponding popular divinities; and the lower
triad was called by the uninitiated, Ceres, Vulcan or Pluto, and
Proserpine, and the <i>Cadmilos</i> became Mercury. It is not
without ground that I direct your attention, under these
circumstances, to the probable derivation of some portion of this
most remarkable system from patriarchal tradition, and to the
connection of the Cabeiri with the Kabbala.<br>
<br>
<a name="f3kr"></a>The Samothracian mysteries continued in
celebrity till some time after the commencement of the Christian
era. <a href="#f3k">2</a> But they gradually sank with the rest
of the ancient system of mythology, to which, in fact, they did
not properly belong. The peculiar doctrines, however, were
preserved in the memories of the initiated, and handed down by
individuals. No doubt they were propagated in Europe, and it is
not improbable that Paracelsus received many of his opinions from
such persons, and I think a connection may be traced between him
and Jacob Behmen.<br>
<br>
The Asiatic supernatural beings are all produced by imagining an
excessive magnitude, or an excessive smallness combined with
great power; and the broken associations, which must have given
rise to such conceptions, are the sources of the interest which
they inspire, as exhibiting, through the working of the
imagination, the idea of power in the will. This is delightfully
exemplified in the <i>Arabian Nights' Entertainments</i>, and
indeed, more or less, in other works of the same kind. In all
these there is the same activity of mind as in dreaming, that is
&shy; an exertion of the fancy in the combination and
recombination of familiar objects so as to produce novel and
wonderful imagery. To this must be added that these tales cause
no deep feeling of a moral kind &shy; whether of religion or
love; but an impulse of motion is communicated to the mind
without excitement, and this is the reason of their being so
generally read and admired.<br>
<br>
I think it not unlikely that the <i>Milesian Tales</i> contained
the germs of many of those now in the Arabian Nights; indeed it
is scarcely possible to doubt that the Greek empire must have
left deep impression on the Persian intellect. So also many of
the Roman Catholic legends are taken from Apuleius. In that
exquisite story of <i>Cupid and Psyche</i>, the allegory is of no
injury to the dramatic vividness of the tale. It is evidently a
philosophic attempt to parry Christianity with a
<i>quasi</i>-Platonic account of the fall and redemption of the
soul.<br>
<br>
The charm of De Foe's works, especially of <i>Robinson
Crusoe</i>, is founded on the same principle. It always
interests, never agitates. Crusoe himself is merely a
representative of humanity in general; neither his intellectual
nor his moral qualities set him above the middle degree of
mankind; his only prominent characteristic is the spirit of
enterprise and wandering, which is, nevertheless, a very common
disposition. You will observe that all that is wonderful in this
tale is the result of external circumstances &shy; of things
which fortune brings to Crusoe's hand.<br>

<h3><a name="f3lr"></a>Notes on Robinson Crusoe  <a href=
"#f3l">1</a></h3>

<blockquote>(Vol. i. p. 17.)<br>
But my ill fate pushed me on now with an obstinacy that nothing
could resist; and though I had several times loud calls from my
reason, and my more composed judgment to go home, yet I had no
power to do it. I know not what to call this, nor will I urge
that it is a secret overruling decree that hurries us on to be
the instruments of our own destruction, even though it be before
us, and that we rush upon it with our eyes open.</blockquote>

<br>
 The wise only possess ideas; the greater part of mankind are
possessed by them. Robinson Crusoe was not conscious of the
master impulse, even because it was his master, and had taken, as
he says, full possession of him. When once the mind, in despite
of the remonstrating conscience, has abandoned its free power to
a haunting impulse or idea, then whatever tends to give depth and
vividness to this idea or indefinite imagination, increases its
despotism, and in the same proportion renders the reason and free
will ineffectual. Now, fearful calamities, sufferings, horrors,
and hair-breadth escapes will have this effect, far more than
even sensual pleasure and prosperous incidents. Hence the evil
consequences of sin in such cases, instead of retracting or
deterring the sinner, goad him on to his destruction. This is the
moral of Shakspeare's <i>Macbeth</i>, and the true solution of
this paragraph, &shy; not any overruling decree of divine wrath,
but the tyranny of the sinner's own evil imagination, which he
has voluntarily chosen as his master.<br>
<br>
Compare the contemptuous Swift with the contemned De Foe, and how
superior will the latter be found! But by what test? &shy; Even
by this; that the writer who makes me sympathize with his
presentations with the whole of my being, is more estimable than
he who calls forth, and appeals but to, a part of my being &shy;
my sense of the ludicrous, for instance. De Foe's excellence it
is, to make me forget my specific class, character, and
circumstances, and to raise me while I read him, into the
universal man.<br>


<blockquote>I smiled to myself at the sight of this money: "O
drug!" said I aloud, &amp;c. <i>However, upon second thoughts, I took
it away;</i> and wrapping all this in a piece of canvass,
&amp;c.</blockquote>

<br>
 Worthy of Shakspeare! &shy; and yet the simple semicolon after
it, the instant passing on without the least pause of reflex
consciousness, is more exquisite and masterlike than the touch
itself. A meaner writer, a Marmontel, would have put an (!) after
<i>'away,'</i> and have commenced a fresh paragraph. (30th July,
1830.)<br>


<blockquote>(P. 111)<br>
And I must confess, my religious thankfulness to God's providence
began to abate too, upon the discovering that all this was
nothing but what was common; though I ought to have been as
thankful for so strange and unforeseen a providence, as if it had
been miraculous.</blockquote>

<br>
 To make men feel the truth of this is one characteristic object
of the miracles worked by Moses;-in them the providence is
miraculous, the miracles providential.<br>


<blockquote>(P. 126.)<br>
The growing up of the corn, as is hinted in my <i>Journal</i>,
had, at first, some little influence upon me, and began to affect
me with seriousness, as long as I thought it had something
miraculous in it, &amp;c.</blockquote>

<br>
 By far the ablest vindication of miracles which I have met with.
It is indeed the true ground, the proper purpose and intention of
a miracle.<br>


<blockquote>(P. 141.)<br>
To think that this was all my own, that I was king and lord of
all this country indefeasibly, &amp;c.</blockquote>

<br>
 By the by, what is the law of England respecting this? Suppose I
had discovered, or been wrecked on an uninhabited island, would
it be mine or the king's?<br>


<blockquote>(P. 223.) I considered &shy; that as I could not
foresee what the ends of divine wisdom might be in all this, so I
was not to dispute his sovereignty, who, as I was his creature,
had an undoubted right, by creation, to govern and dispose of me
absolutely as he thought fit, &amp;c.</blockquote>

<br>
 I could never understand this reasoning, grounded on a complete
misapprehension of St. Paul's image of the potter, Rom. ix., or
rather I do fully understand the absurdity of it. The
susceptibility of pain and pleasure, of good and evil,
constitutes a right in every creature endowed therewith in
relation to every rational and moral being, &shy;
a<i>fortiori</i>, therefore, to the Supreme Reason, to the
absolutely good Being. Remember Davenant's verses; &shy; <br>


<blockquote>Doth it our reason's mutinies appease<br>
 To say, the potter may his own clay mould<br>
 To every use, or in what shape he please,<br>
 At first not counsell'd, nor at last controll'd?<br>
<br>
 Power's hand can neither easy be, nor strict<br>
 To lifeless clay, which ease nor torment knows,<br>
 And where it cannot favour or afflict,<br>
 It neither justice or injustice shows.<br>
<br>
 But souls have life, and life eternal too:<br>
 Therefore, if doom'd before they can offend,<br>
 It seems to show what heavenly power can do,<br>
 But does not in that deed that power commend.<br>
<br>
 (<i>Death of Astragon</i>. st. 88, &amp;c. P. 232-3.)<br>
<br>
 And this I must observe with grief too, that the discomposure of
my mind had too great impressions also upon the religious parts
of my thoughts, &shy; praying to God being properly an act of the
mind, not of the body.</blockquote>

<br>
 As justly conceived as it is beautifully expressed. And a mighty
motive for habitual prayer; for this cannot but greatly
facilitate the performance of rational prayer even in moments of
urgent distress.<br>


<blockquote>(P. 244.)<br>
That this would justify the conduct of the Spaniards in all their
barbarities practised in America.</blockquote>

<br>
 De Foe was a true philanthropist, who had risen above the
antipathies of nationality; but he was evidently partial to the
Spanish character, which, however, it is not, I fear, possible to
acquit of cruelty. Witness the Netherlands, the Inquisition, the
late Guerilla warfare, &amp;c.<br>


<blockquote>(P. 249.)<br>
 That I shall not discuss, and perhaps cannot account for; but
certainly they are a proof of the converse of spirits,
&amp;c.</blockquote>

<br>
 This reminds me of a conversation I once over heard. "How a
statement so injurious to Mr. A. and so contrary to the truth,
should have been made to you by Mr. B. I do not pretend to
account for; &shy; only I know of my own knowledge that B. is an
inveterate liar, and has long borne malice against Mr. A.; and I
can prove that he has repeatedly declared that in some way or
other he would do Mr. A. a mischief."<br>


<blockquote>(P. 254.)<br>
 The place I was in was a most delightful cavity or grotto of its
kind, as could be expected, though perfectly dark; the floor was
dry and level, and had a sort of small loose gravel on it,
&amp;c.</blockquote>

<br>
 How accurate an observer of nature De Foe was! The reader will
at once recognize Professor Buckland's caves and the diluvial
gravel.<br>


<blockquote>(P. 308.)<br>
 I entered into a long discourse with him about the devil, the
original of him, his rebellion against God, his enmity to man,
the reason of it, his setting himself up in the dark parts of the
world to be worshipped instead of God, &amp;c.</blockquote>

<br>
 I presume that Milton's <i>Paradise Lost</i> must have been
bound up with one of Crusoe's <i>Bibles</i>; otherwise I should
be puzzled to know where he found all this history of the Old
Gentleman. Not a word of it in the <i>Bible</i> itself, I am
quite sure. But to be serious. De Foe did not reflect that all
these difficulties are attached to a mere fiction, or, at the
best, an allegory, supported by a few popular phrases and figures
of speech used incidentally or dramatically by the Evangelists,
&shy; and that the existence of a personal, intelligent, evil
being, the counterpart and antagonist of God, is in direct
contradiction to the most express declarations of Holy Writ.
<i>"Shall there be evil in a city, and the Lord hath not done
it?"</i> Amos, iii. 6. <i>"I make peace and create evil."</i>
Isa. xlv. 7. This is the deep mystery of the abyss of God.<br>


<blockquote>(Vol. ii. p. 3.)<br>
 I have often heard persons of good judgment say, ... that there
is no such thing as a spirit appearing, a ghost walking, and the
like, &amp;c.</blockquote>

<br>
 I cannot conceive a better definition of Body than "spirit
appearing," or of a flesh-and-blood man than a rational spirit
apparent. But a spirit <i>per se</i> appearing is tantamount to a
spirit appearing without its appearances. And as for ghosts, it
is enough for a man of common sense to observe, that a ghost and
a shadow are concluded in the same definition, that is,
visibility without tangibility.<br>


<blockquote>(P. 9.)<br>
 She was, in a few words the stay of all my affairs, the centre
of all my enterprises, &amp;c.</blockquote>

<br>
 The stay of his affairs, the centre of his interests, the
regulator of his schemes and movements, whom it soothed his pride
to submit to, and in complying with whose wishes the conscious
sensation of his acting will increased the impulse, while it
disguised the coercion, of duty! &shy; the clinging dependent,
yet the strong supporter &shy; the comforter, the comfort, and
the soul's living home! This is De Foe's comprehensive character
of the wife, as she should be; and, to the honour of womanhood be
it spoken, there are few neighbourhoods in which one name at
least might not be found for the portrait.<br>
 The exquisite paragraphs in this and the next page, in addition
to others scattered, though with a sparing hand, through his
novels, afford sufficient proof that De Foe was a first-rate
master of periodic style; but with sound judgment, and the fine
tact of genius, he has avoided it as adverse to, nay,
incompatible with, the every-day matter of fact realness, which
forms the charm and the character of all his romances. The
<i>Robinson Crusoe</i> is like the vision of a happy night-mair,
such as a denizen of Elysium might be supposed to have from a
little excess in his nectar and ambrosia supper. Our imagination
is kept in full play, excited to the highest; yet all the while
we are touching, or touched by, common flesh and blood.<br>


<blockquote>(P. 67.)<br>
 The ungrateful creatures began to be as insolent and troublesome
as before, &amp;c.</blockquote>

<br>
 How should it be otherwise? They were idle; and when we will not
sow corn, the devil will be sure to sow weeds, night-shade,
henbane, and devil's-bit.<br>


<blockquote>(P. 82.)<br>
 That hardened villain was so far from denying it, that he said
it was true, and &shy; &shy; him they would do it still before
they had done with them.</blockquote>

<br>
 Observe when a man has once abandoned himself to wickedness, he
cannot stop, and does not join the devils till he has become a
devil himself. Rebelling against his conscience he becomes the
slave of his own furious will.<br>
<br>
One excellence of De Foe, amongst many, is his sacrifice of
lesser interest to the greater because more universal. Had he (as
without any improbability he might have done) given his Robinson
Crusoe any of the turn for natural history, which forms so
striking and delightful a feature in the equally uneducated
Dampier; &shy; had he made him find out qualities and uses in the
before (to him) unknown plants of the island, discover, for
instance, a substitute for hops, or describe birds, &amp;c. &shy;
many delightful pages and incidents might have enriched the book;
&shy; but then Crusoe would have ceased to be the universal
representative, the person, for whom every reader could
substitute himself. But now nothing is done, thought, suffered,
or desired, but what every man can imagine himself doing,
thinking, feeling, or wishing for. Even so very easy a problem as
that of finding a substitute for ink, is with exquisite judgment
made to baffle Crusoe's inventive faculties. And in what he does,
he arrives at no excellence; he does not make basket work like
Will Atkins; the carpentering, tailoring, pottery, &amp;c. are all
just what will answer his purposes, and those are confined to
needs that all men have, and comforts that all men desire. Crusoe
rises only to the point to which all men may be made to feel that
they might, and that they ought to, rise in religion, &shy; to
resignation, dependence on, and thankful acknowledgement of, the
divine mercy and goodness.<br>
 In the education of children, love is first to be instilled, and
out of love obedience is to be educed. Then impulse and power
should be given to the intellect, and the ends of a moral being
be exhibited. For this object thus much is effected by works of
imagination; &shy; that they carry the mind out of self, and show
the possible of the good and the great in the human character.
The height, whatever it may be, of the imaginative standard will
do no harm; we are commanded to imitate one who is inimitable. We
should address ourselves to those faculties in a child's mind,
which are first awakened by nature, and consequently first admit
of cultivation, that is to say, the memory and the imagination.
The comparing power, the judgment, is not at that age active, and
ought not to be forcibly excited, as is too frequently and
mistakenly done in the modern systems of education, which can
only lead to selfish views, debtor and creditor principles of
virtue, and an inflated sense of merit. In the imagination of man
exist the seeds of all moral and scientific improvement;
chemistry was first alchemy, and out of astrology sprang
astronomy. In the childhood of those sciences the imagination
opened a way, and furnished materials, on which the ratiocinative
powers in a maturer state operated with success. The imagination
is the distinguishing characteristic of man as a progressive
being; and I repeat that it ought to be carefully guided and
strengthened as the indispensable means and instrument of
continued amelioration and refinement. Men of genius and goodness
are generally restless in their minds in the present, and this,
because they are by a law of their nature unremittingly regarding
themselves in the future, and contemplating the possible of moral
and intellectual advance towards perfection. Thus we live by hope
and faith; thus we are for the most part able to realize what we
will, and thus we accomplish the end of our being. The
contemplation of futurity inspires humility of soul in our
judgment of the present.<br>
<br>
I think the memory of children cannot, in reason, be too much
stored with the objects and facts of natural history. God opens
the images of nature, like the leaves of a book, before the eyes
of his creature, Man &shy; and teaches him all that is grand and
beautiful in the foaming cataract, the glassy lake, and the
floating mist.<br>
<br>
The common modern novel, in which there is no imagination, but a
miserable struggle to excite and gratify mere curiosity, ought,
in my judgment, to be wholly forbidden to children. Novel-reading
of this sort is especially injurious to the growth of the
imagination, the judgment, and the morals, especially to the
latter, because it excites mere feelings without at the same time
ministering an impulse to action. Women are good novelists, but
indifferent poets; and this because they rarely or never
thoroughly distinguish between fact and fiction. In the jumble of
the two lies the secret of the modern novel, which is the
<i>medium aliquid</i> between them, having just so much of
fiction as to obscure the fact, and so much of fact as to render
the fiction insipid. The perusal of a fashionable lady's novel is
to me very much like looking at the scenery and decorations of a
theatre by broad daylight. The source of the common fondness for
novels of this sort rests in that dislike of vacancy and that
love of sloth, which are inherent in the human mind; they afford
excitement without producing reaction. By reaction I mean an
activity of the intellectual faculties, which shows itself in
consequent reasoning and observation, and originates action and
conduct according to a principle. Thus, the act of thinking
presents two sides for contemplation, &shy; that of external
causality, in which the train of thought may be considered as the
result of outward impressions, of accidental combinations, of
fancy, or the associations of the memory, &shy; and on the other
hand, that of internal causality, or of the energy of the will on
the mind itself. Thought, therefore, might thus be regarded as
passive or active; and the same faculties may in a popular sense
be expressed as perception or observation, fancy or imagination,
memory or recollection.<br>

<h3><a name="section46">Lecture XII &shy; Dreams &shy;
Apparitions &shy; Alchemists &shy; Personality of the Evil Being
&shy; Bodily Identity</a></h3>

<p>It is a general, but, as it appears to me, a mistaken opinion,
that in our ordinary dreams we judge the objects to be real. I
say our ordinary dreams; &shy; because as to the night-mair the
opinion is to a considerable extent just. But the night-mair is
not a mere dream, but takes place when the waking state of the
brain is recommencing, and most often during a rapid alternation,
a twinkling, as it were, of sleeping and waking; &shy; while
either from pressure on, or from some derangement in, the stomach
or other digestive organs acting on the external skin (which is
still in sympathy with the stomach and bowels,) and benumbing it,
the sensations sent up to the brain by double touch (that is,
when my own hand touches my side or breast,) are so faint as to
be merely equivalent to the sensation given by single touch, as
when another person's hand touches me. The mind, therefore, which
at all times, with and without our distinct consciousness, seeks
for, and assumes, some outward cause for every impression from
without, and which in sleep, by aid of the imaginative faculty,
converts its judgments respecting the cause into a personal image
as being the cause, &shy; the mind, I say, in this case, deceived
by past experience, attributes the painful sensation received to
a correspondent agent, &shy; an assassin, for instance, stabbing
at the side, or a goblin sitting on the breast. Add too that the
impressions of the bed, curtains, room, &amp;c. received by the eyes
in the half-moments of their opening, blend with, and give
vividness and appropriate distance to, the dream image which
returns when they close again; and thus we unite the actual
perceptions, or their immediate reliques, with the phantoms of
the inward sense; and in this manner so confound the half-waking,
half-sleeping, reasoning power, that we actually do pass a
positive judgment on the reality of what we see and hear, though
often accompanied by doubt and self-questioning, which, as I have
myself experienced, will at times become strong enough, even
before we awake, to convince us that it is what it is &shy;
namely, the night-mair.<br>
<br>
In ordinary dreams we do not judge the objects to be real; &shy;
we simply do not determine that they are unreal. The sensations
which they seem to produce, are in truth the causes and occasions
of the images; of which there are two obvious proofs: first, that
in dreams the strangest and most sudden metamorphoses do not
create any sensation of surprise: and the second, that as to the
most dreadful images, which during the dream were accompanied
with agonies of terror, we merely awake, or turn round on the
other side, and off fly both image and agony, which would be
impossible if the sensations were produced by the images. This
has always appeared to me an absolute demonstration of the true
nature of ghosts and apparitions &shy; such I mean of the tribe
as were not pure inventions. Fifty years ago, (and to this day in
the ruder parts of Great Britain and Ireland, in almost every
kitchen and in too many parlours it is nearly the same,) you
might meet persons who would assure you in the most solemn
manner, so that you could not doubt their veracity at least, that
they had seen an apparition of such and such a person, &shy; in
many cases, that the apparition had spoken to them; and they
would describe themselves as having been in an agony of terror.
They would tell you the story in perfect health. Now take the
other class of facts, in which real ghosts have appeared; &shy; I
mean, where figures have been dressed up for the purpose of
passing for apparitions:&shy; in every instance I have known or
heard of (and I have collected very many) the consequence has
been either sudden death, or fits, or idiocy, or mania, or a
brain fever. Whence comes the difference? evidently from this,
&shy; that in the one case the whole of the nervous system has
been by slight internal causes gradually and all together brought
into a certain state, the sensation of which is extravagantly
exaggerated during sleep, and of which the images are the mere
effects and exponents, as the motions of the weathercock are of
the wind; &shy; while in the other case, the image rushing
through the senses upon a nervous system, wholly unprepared,
actually causes the sensation, which is sometimes powerful enough
to produce a total check, and almost always a lesion or
inflammation. Who has not witnessed the difference in shock when
we have leaped down half-a-dozen steps intentionally, and that of
having missed a single stair. How comparatively severe the latter
is! The fact really is, as to apparitions, that the terror
produces the image instead of the contrary; for <i>in omnem actum
perceptionis influit imaginatio,</i> as says Wolfe.<br>
<br>
O, strange is the self-power of the imagination &shy; when
painful sensations have made it their interpreter, or returning
gladsomeness or convalescence has made its chilled and evanished
figures and landscape bud, blossom, and live in scarlet, green,
and snowy white (like the fire-screen inscribed with the nitrate
and muriate of cobalt,) &shy; strange is the power to represent
the events and circumstances, even to the anguish or the triumph
of the <i>quasi</i>-credent soul, while the necessary conditions,
the only possible causes of such contingencies, are known to be
in fact quite hopeless; &shy; yea, when the pure mind would
recoil from the eve-lengthened shadow of an approaching hope, as
from a crime;-and yet the effect shall have place, and substance,
and living energy, and, on a blue islet of ether, in a whole sky
of blackest cloudage, shine like a firstling of creation!<br>
<br>
To return, however to apparitions, and by way of an amusing
illustration of the nature and value of even contemporary
testimony upon such subjects, I will present you with a passage,
literally translated by my friend, Mr. Southey, from the well
known work of Bernal Dias, one of the companions of Cortes, in
the conquest of Mexico:<br>
</p>

<blockquote>Here it is that Gomara says, that Francisco de Morla
rode forward on a dappled grey horse, before Cortes and the
cavalry came up, and that the apostle St. Iago, or St. Peter, was
there. I must say that all our works and victories are by the
hand of our Lord Jesus Christ, and that in this battle there were
for each of us so many Indians, that they could have covered us
with handfuls of earth, if it had not been that the great mercy
of God helped us in every thing. And it may be that he of whom
Gomara speaks, was the glorious Santiago or San Pedro, and I, as
a sinner, was not worthy to see him; but he whom I saw there and
knew, was Francisco de Morla on a chestnut horse, who came up
with Cortes. And it seems to me that now while I am writing this,
the whole war is represented before these sinful eyes, just in
the manner as we then went through it. And though I, as an
unworthy sinner, might not deserve to see either of these
glorious apostles, there were in our company above four hundred
soldiers, and Cortes, and many other knights; and it would have
been talked of and testified, and they would have made a church,
when they peopled the town, which would have been called Santiago
de la Vittoria, or San Pedro de la Vittoria, as it is now called,
Santa Maria de la Vittoria. And if it was, as Gomara says, bad
Christians must we have been, when our Lord God sent us his holy
apostles, not to acknowledge his great mercy, and venerate his
church daily. And would to God, it had been, as the Chronicler
says! &shy; but till I read his Chronicle, I never heard such a
thing from any of the conquerors who were there.</blockquote>

<br>
 Now, what if the odd accident of such a man as Bernal Dias'
writing a history had not taken place! Gomara's account, the
account of a contemporary, which yet must have been read by
scores who were present, would have remained uncontradicted. I
remember the story of a man, whom the devil met and talked with,
but left at a particular lane; &shy; the man followed him with
his eyes, and when the devil got to the turning or bend of the
lane, he vanished! The devil was upon this occasion drest in a
blue coat, plush waistcoat, leather breeches and boots, and
talked and looked just like a common man, except as to a
particular lock of hair which he had. "And how do you know then
that it was the devil?" &shy; "How do I know," replied the
fellow, &shy; "why, if it had not been the devil, being drest as
he was, and looking as he did, why should I have been sore
stricken with fright, when I first saw him? and why should I be
in such a tremble all the while he talked? And, moreover, he had
a particular sort of a kind of a lock, and when I groaned and
said, upon every question he asked me, Lord have mercy upon me!
or, Christ have mercy upon me! it was plain enough that he did
not like it, and so he left me!" &shy; The man was quite sober
when he related this story; but as it happened to him on his
return from market, it is probable that he was then muddled. As
for myself, I was actually seen in Newgate in the winter of 1798;
&shy; the person who saw me there, said he had asked my name of
Mr. A. B. a known acquaintance of mine, who told him that it was
young Coleridge, who had married the eldest Miss &shy; &shy; .
"Will you go to Newgate, Sir?" said my friend;" for I assure you
that Mr. C. is now in Germany." "Very willingly," replied the
other, and away they went to Newgate, and sent for A. B.
"Coleridge," cried he, "in Newgate! God forbid!" I said, "young
Col &shy; &shy; who married the eldest Miss &shy; &shy; ." The
names were something similar. And yet this person had himself
really seen me at one of my lectures.<br>
<br>
I remember, upon the occasion of my inhaling the nitrous oxide at
the Royal Institution, about five minutes afterwards, a gentleman
came from the other side of the theatre and said to me, &shy;
"Was it not ravishingly delightful, Sir?" &shy; "It was highly
pleasurable, no doubt." &shy; "Was it not very like sweet music?"
&shy; "I cannot say I perceived any analogy to it." &shy; "Did
you not say it was very like Mrs. Billington singing by your
ear?" &shy; "No, Sir, I said that while I was breathing the gas,
there was a singing in my ears."<br>
<br>
To return, however, to dreams, I not only believe, for the
reasons given, but have more than once actually experienced that
the most fearful forms, when produced simply by association,
instead of causing fear, operate no other effect than the same
would do if they had passed through my mind as thoughts, while I
was composing a faery tale; the whole depending on the wise and
gracious law in our nature, that the actual bodily sensations,
called forth according to the law of association by thoughts and
images of the mind, never greatly transcend the limits of
pleasurable feeling in a tolerably healthy frame, unless where an
act of the judgment supervenes and interprets them as purporting
instant danger to ourselves.<br>
<br>
<a href="#fm1">1</a>  There<a name="fm1r"></a> have been very
strange and incredible stories told of and by the alchemists.
Perhaps in some of them there may have been a specific form of
mania, originating in the constant intension of the mind on an
imaginary end, associated with an immense variety of means, all
of them substances not familiar to men in general, and in forms
strange and unlike to those of ordinary nature. Sometimes, it
seems as if the alchemists wrote like the Pythagoreans on music,
imagining a metaphysical and inaudible music as the basis of the
audible. It is clear that by sulphur they meant the solar rays or
light, and by mercury the principle of ponderability, so that
their theory was the same with that of the Heraclitic physics, or
the modern German <i>Naturphilosophie,</i> which deduces all
things from light and gravitation, each being bipolar;
gravitation=north and south, or attraction and repulsion;
light=east and west, or contraction and dilation; and gold being
the tetrad, or interpenetration of both, as water was the dyad of
light, and iron the dyad of gravitation.<br>
<br>
It is, probably, unjust to accuse the alchemists generally of
dabbling with attempts at magic in the common sense of the term.
The supposed exercise of magical power always involved some moral
guilt, directly or indirectly, as in stealing a piece of meat to
lay on warts, touching humours with the hand of an executed
person, &amp;c. Rites of this sort and other practices of sorcery
have always been regarded with trembling abhorrence by all
nations, even the most ignorant, as by the Africans, the Hudson's
Bay people and others. The alchemists were, no doubt, often
considered as dealers in art magic, and many of them were not
unwilling that such a belief should be prevalent; and the more
earnest among them evidently looked at their association of
substances, fumigations, and other chemical operations as merely
ceremonial, and seem, therefore, to have had a deeper meaning,
that of evoking a latent power. It would be profitable to make a
collection of all the cases of cures by magical charms and
incantations; much useful information might, probably, be derived
from it; for it is to be observed that such rites are the form in
which medical knowledge would be preserved amongst a barbarous
and ignorant people.<br>

<h3><a name="f4nr"></a>Note  <a href="#f4n">1</a>  June,
1827.</h3>

<br>
The apocryphal book of <i>Tobit</i> consists of a very simple,
but beautiful and interesting, family-memoir, into which some
later Jewish poet or fabulist of Alexandria wove the ridiculous
and frigid machinery, borrowed from the popular superstitions of
the Greeks (though, probably, of Egyptian origin), and
accommodated, clumsily enough, to the purer monotheism of the
Mosaic law. <i>The Rape of the Lock</i> is another instance of a
simple tale thus enlarged at a later period, though in this case
by the same author, and with a very different result. Now unless
Mr. Hillhouse is Romanist enough to receive this nursery-tale
garnish of a domestic incident as grave history and holy writ,
(for which, even from learned Roman Catholics, he would gain more
credit as a very obedient child of the Church than as a biblical
critic), he will find it no easy matter to support this assertion
of his by the passages of Scripture here referred to,
consistently with any sane interpretation of their import and
purpose.<br>
<br>
 <br>
<b>I.</b>  The Fallen Spirits.<br>
<br>
This is the mythological form, or, if you will, the symbolical
representation, of a profound idea necessary as the
<i>prae-suppositum</i> of the Christian scheme, or a postulate of
reason, indispensable, if we would render the existence of a
world of finites compatible with the assumption of a
super-mundane God, not one with the world. In short, this idea is
the condition under which alone the reason of man can retain the
doctrine of an infinite and absolute Being, and yet keep clear of
pantheism as exhibited by Benedict Spinosa.<br>
<br>
<br>
 <b>II.</b>  The Egyptian Magicians.<br>
<br>
This whole narrative is probably a relic of the old diplomatic
<i>lingua-arcana,</i> or state-symbolique &shy; in which the
prediction of events is expressed as the immediate causing of
them. Thus the prophet is said to destroy the city, the
destruction of which he predicts. The word which our version
renders by <i>"enchantments"</i> signifies "flames or burnings,"
by which it is probable that the Egyptians were able to deceive
the spectators, and substitute serpents for staves. See Parkhurst
<i>in voce.</i><br>
<br>
And with regard to the possessions in the <i>Gospels</i>, bear in
mind first of all, that spirits are not necessarily souls or
<i>I's</i> (<i>ich-heiten</i> or <i>self-consciousnesses</i>),
and that the most ludicrous absurdities would follow from taking
them as such in the Gospel instances; and secondly, that the
Evangelist, who has recorded the most of these incidents, himself
speaks of one of these possessed persons as a lunatic; &shy; <img
src="images/ColLitRemGk14.gif" width="419" height="29" alt=
"Greek: selaeniazetai &shy; epsaelthen ap auton to daimonion">
<i>Matt</i>. xvii. 15.18.) while St. John names them not at all,
but seems to include them under the description of diseased or
deranged persons. That madness may result from spiritual causes,
and not only or principally from physical ailments, may readily
be admitted. Is not our will itself a spiritual power? Is it not
the spirit of the man? The mind of a rational and responsible
being (that is, of a free-agent) is a spirit, though it does not
follow that all spirits are minds. Who shall dare determine what
spiritual influences may not arise out of the collective evil
wills of wicked men? Even the bestial life, sinless in animals
and their nature, may when awakened in the man and by his own act
admitted into his will, become a spiritual influence. He receives
a nature into his will, which by this very act becomes a corrupt
will; and <i>vice versa,</i> this will becomes his nature, and
thus a corrupt nature. This may be conceded; and this is all that
the recorded words of our Saviour absolutely require in order to
receive an appropriate sense; but this is altogether different
from making spirits to be devils, and devils self-conscious
individuals.<br>

<blockquote><i>A Christian's conflicts and conquests</i>, p.
459.<br>
By the devil we are to understand that apostate spirit which fell
from God, and is always designing to hale down others from God
also. The Old Dragon (mentioned in the Revelation) with his tail
drew down the third part of the stars of heaven and cast them to
the earth.</blockquote>

<br>
 How much is it to be regretted, that so enlightened and able a
divine as Smith, had not philosophically and scripturally
enucleated this so difficult yet important question, &shy;
respecting the personal existence of the evil principle; that is,
whether as <img src="images/ColLitRemGk15.gif" width="78" height="30"
alt="to theion"> of paganism is <img src="images/ColLitRemGk16.gif"

"to ponaeron"> is to be <img src="images/ColLitRemGk18.gif" width="105"
height="32" alt="o ponaeros"> , &shy; and whether this is an
express doctrine of Christ, and not merely a Jewish dogma left
undisturbed to fade away under the increasing light of the
Gospel, instead of assuming the former, and confirming the
position by a verse from a poetic tissue of visual symbols, &shy;
a verse alien from the subject, and by which the Apocalypt
enigmatized the Neronian persecutions and the apostacy through
fear occasioned by it in a large number of converts.<br>


<blockquote>(<i>Ib</i>. p. 463.)<br>
 When we say, the devil is continually busy with us, I mean not
only some apostate spirit as one particular being, but that
spirit of apostacy which is lodged in all men's natures; and this
may seem particularly to be aimed at in this place, if we observe
the context:&shy; as the scripture speaks of Christ not only as a
particular person, but as a divine principle in holy souls.
Indeed the devil is not only the name of one particular thing,
but a nature.</blockquote>

<br>
 May I not venture to suspect that this was Smith's own belief
and judgment? and that his conversion of the Satan, that is,
<i>circuitor</i>, or minister of police (what our Sterne calls
the accusing angel) in the prologue to Job into the devil was a
mere condescension to the prevailing prejudice? Here, however, he
speaks like himself, and like a true religious philosopher, who
felt that the personality of evil spirits is a trifling question,
compared with the personality of the evil principle. This is
indeed most momentous.<br>

<h3>Note on a passage in <i>The Life of Henry, Earl of
Morland</i>. 20th June, 1827.</h3>

<br>
The defect of this and all similar theories that I am acquainted
with, or rather, let me say, the <i>desideratum</i>, is the
neglect of a previous definition of the term "body." What do you
mean by it? The immediate grounds of a man's size, visibility,
tangibility, &amp;c.? &shy; But these are in a continual flux even as
a column of smoke. The material particles of carbon, nitrogen,
oxygen, hydrogen, lime, phosphorus, sulphur, soda, iron, that
constitute the ponderable organism in May, 1827, at the moment of
Pollio's death in his 70th year, have no better claim to be
called his "body," than the numerical particles of the same names
that constituted the ponderable mass in May, 1787, in Pollio's
prime of manhood in his 30th year; &shy; the latter no less than
the former go into the grave, that is, suffer dissolution, the
one in a series, the other simultaneously. The result to the
particles is precisely the same in both, and of both therefore we
must say with holy Paul, &shy; <i>"Thou fool! that which thou
sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be,"</i> &amp;c. Neither
this nor that is the body that abideth. Abideth, I say; for that
which riseth again must have remained, though perhaps in an inert
state. &shy; It is not dead, but sleepeth; &shy; that is, it is
not dissolved any more than the exterior or phenomenal organism
appears to us dissolved when it lieth in apparent inactivity
during our sleep.<br>
<br>
Sound reasoning this, to the best of my judgment, as far as it
goes. But how are we to explain the reaction of this fluxional
body on the animal? In each moment the particles by the informing
force of the living principle constitute an organ not only of
motion and sense, but of consciousness. The organ plays on the
organist. How is this conceivable? The solution requires a depth,
stillness, and subtlety of spirit not only for its discovery, but
even for the understanding of it when discovered, and in the most
appropriate words enunciated. I can merely give a hint. The
particles themselves must have an interior and gravitative being,
and the multeity must be a removable or at least suspensible
accident. <br>

<p>Man communicates by articulation of sounds, and paramountly by
the memory in the ear; nature by the impression of bounds and
surfaces on the eye, and through the eye it gives significance
and appropriation, and thus the conditions of memory, or the
capability of being remembered, to sounds, smells, &amp;c. Now Art,
used collectively for painting, sculpture, architecture and
music, is the mediatress between, and reconciler of, nature and
man. It is, therefore, the power of humanizing nature, of
infusing the thoughts and passions of man into every thing which
is the object of his contemplation; colour, form, motion and
sound are the elements which it combines, and it stamps them into
unity in the mould of a moral idea.<br>
<br>
The primary art is writing; &shy; primary, if we regard the
purpose abstracted from the different modes of realizing it,
those steps of progression of which the instances are still
visible in the lower degrees of civilization. First, there is
mere gesticulation; then rosaries or <i>wampun</i>; then
picture-language; then hieroglyphics, and finally alphabetic
letters. These all consist of a translation of man into nature,
of a substitution of the visible for the audible.<br>
<br>
The so called music of savage tribes as little deserves the name
of art for the understanding as the ear warrants it for music.
Its lowest state is a mere expression of passion by sounds which
the passion itself necessitates; &shy; the highest amounts to no
more than a voluntary reproduction of these sounds in the absence
of the occasioning causes, so as to give the pleasure of
contrast, &shy; for example, by the various outcries of battle in
the song of security and triumph. Poetry also is purely human;
for all its materials are from the mind, and all its products are
for the mind. But it is the apotheosis of the former state, in
which by excitement of the associative power passion itself
imitates order, and the order resulting produces a pleasurable
passion, and thus it elevates the mind by making its feelings the
object of its reflexion. So likewise, whilst it recalls the
sights and sounds that had accompanied the occasions of the
original passions, poetry impregnates them with an interest not
their own by means of the passions, and yet tempers the passion
by the calming power which all distinct images exert on the human
soul. In this way poetry is the preparation for art, inasmuch as
it avails itself of the forms of nature to recall, to express,
and to modify the thoughts and feelings of the mind. Still,
however, poetry can only act through the intervention of
articulate speech, which is so peculiarly human, that in all
languages it constitutes the ordinary phrase by which man and
nature are contradistinguished. It is the original force of the
word 'brute,' and even 'mute,' and 'dumb' do not convey the
absence of sound, but the absence of articulated sounds.<br>
<br>
As soon as the human mind is intelligibly addressed by an outward
image exclusively of articulate speech, so soon does art
commence. But please to observe that I have laid particular
stress on the words 'human mind,' &shy; meaning to exclude
thereby all results common to man and all other sentient
creatures, and consequently confining myself to the effect
produced by the congruity of the animal impression with the
reflective powers of the mind; so that not the thing presented,
but that which is re-presented by the thing shall be the source
of the pleasure. In this sense nature itself is to a religious
observer the art of God; and for the same cause art itself might
be defined as of a middle quality between a thought and a thing,
or as I said before, the union and reconciliation of that which
is nature with that which is exclusively human. It is the figured
language of thought, and is distinguished from nature by the
unity of all the parts in one thought or idea. Hence nature
itself would give us the impression of a work of art if we could
see the thought which is present at once in the whole and in
every part; and a work of art will be just in proportion as it
adequately conveys the thought, and rich in proportion to the
variety of parts which it holds in unity.<br>
<br>
If, therefore, the term 'mute' be taken as opposed not to sound
but to articulate speech, the old definition of painting will in
fact be the true and best definition of the Fine Arts in general,
that is, <i>muta poesis</i>, mute poesy, and so of course poesy.
And, as all languages perfect themselves by a gradual process of
desynonymizing words originally equivalent, I have cherished the
wish to use the word 'poesy' as the generic or common term, and
to distinguish that species of poesy which is not <i>muta
poesis</i> by its usual name 'poetry;' while of all the other
species which collectively form the Fine Arts, there would remain
this as the common definition, &shy; that they all, like poetry,
are to express intellectual purposes, thoughts, conceptions, and
sentiments which have their origin in the human mind, &shy; not,
however, as poetry does, by means of articulate speech, but as
nature or the divine art does, by form, colour, magnitude,
proportion, or by sound, that is, silently or musically.<br>
<br>
Well! it may be said &shy; but who has ever thought otherwise? We
all know that art is the imitatress of nature. And, doubtless,
the truths which I hope to convey would be barren truisms, if all
men meant the same by the words 'imitate' and 'nature.' But it
would be flattering mankind at large, to presume that such is the
fact. First, to imitate. The impression on the wax is not an
imitation, but a copy, of the seal; the seal itself is an
imitation. But, further, in order to form a philosophic
conception, we must seek for the kind, as the heat in ice,
invisible light, &amp;c. whilst, for practical purposes, we must have
reference to the degree. It is sufficient that philosophically we
understand that in all imitation two elements must coexist, and
not only coexist, but must be perceived as coexisting. These two
constituent elements are likeness and unlikeness, or sameness and
difference, and in all genuine creations of art there must be a
union of these disparates. The artist may take his point of view
where he pleases, provided that the desired effect be perceptibly
produced, &shy; that there be likeness in the difference,
difference in the likeness, and a reconcilement of both in one.
If there be likeness to nature without any check of difference,
the result is disgusting, and the more complete the delusion, the
more loathsome the effect. Why are such simulations of nature, as
wax-work figures of men and women, so disagreeable? Because, not
finding the motion and the life which we expected, we are shocked
as by a falsehood, every circumstance of detail, which before
induced us to be interested, making the distance from truth more
palpable. You set out with a supposed reality and are
disappointed and disgusted with the deception; whilst, in respect
to a work of genuine imitation, you begin with an acknowledged
total difference, and then every touch of nature gives you the
pleasure of an approximation to truth. The fundamental principle
of all this is undoubtedly the horror of falsehood and the love
of truth inherent in the human breast. The Greek tragic dance
rested on these principles, and I can deeply sympathize in
imagination with the Greeks in this favourite part of their
theatrical exhibitions, when I call to mind the pleasure I felt
in beholding the combat of the Horatii and Curiatii most
exquisitely danced in Italy to the music of Cimarosa.<br>
<br>
Secondly, as to nature. We must imitate nature! yes, but what in
nature, &shy; all and every thing? No, the beautiful in nature.
And what then is the beautiful? What is beauty? It is, in the
abstract, the unity of the manifold, the coalescence of the
diverse; in the concrete, it is the union of the shapely
(<i>formosum</i>) with the vital. In the dead organic it depends
on regularity of form, the first and lowest species of which is
the triangle with all its modifications, as in crystals,
architecture, &amp;c.; in the living organic it is not mere
regularity of form, which would produce a sense of formality;
neither is it subservient to any thing beside itself. It may be
present in a disagreeable object, in which the proportion of the
parts constitutes a whole; it does not arise from association, as
the agreeable does, but sometimes lies in the rupture of
association; it is not different to different individuals and
nations, as has been said, nor is it connected with the ideas of
the good, or the fit, or the useful. The sense of beauty is
intuitive, and beauty itself is all that inspires pleasure
without, and aloof from, and even contrarily to, interest.<br>
<br>
If the artist copies the mere nature, the <i>natura naturata</i>,
what idle rivalry? If he proceeds only from a given form, which
is supposed to answer to the notion of beauty, what an emptiness,
what an unreality there always is in his productions, as in
Cipriani's pictures! Believe me, you must master the essence, the
<i>natura naturans</i>, which presupposes a bond between nature
in the higher sense and the soul of man.<br>
<br>
The wisdom in nature is distinguished from that in man by the
co-instantaneity of the plan and the execution; the thought and
the product are one, or are given at once; but there is no reflex
act, and hence there is no moral responsibility. In man there is
reflexion, freedom, and choice; he is, therefore, the head of the
visible creation. In the objects of nature are presented, as in a
mirror, all the possible elements, steps, and processes of
intellect antecedent to consciousness, and therefore to the full
development of the intelligential act; and man's mind is the very
focus of all the rays of intellect which are scattered throughout
the images of nature. Now so to place these images, totalized,
and fitted to the limits of the human mind, as to elicit from,
and to superinduce upon, the forms themselves the moral
reflexions to which they approximate, to make the external
internal, the internal external, to make nature thought, and
thought nature, &shy; this is the mystery of genius in the Fine
Arts. Dare I add that the genius must act on the feeling, that
body is but a striving to become mind, &shy; that it is mind in
its essence!<br>
<br>
In every work of art there is a reconcilement of the external
with the internal; the conscious is so impressed on the
unconscious as to appear in it; as compare mere letters inscribed
on a tomb with figures themselves constituting the tomb. He who
combines the two is the man of genius; and for that reason he
must partake of both. Hence there is in genius itself an
unconscious activity; nay, that is the genius in the man of
genius. And this is the true exposition of the rule that the
artist must first eloign himself from nature in order to return
to her with full effect. Why this? Because if he were to begin by
mere painful copying, he would produce masks only, not forms
breathing life. He must out of his own mind create forms
according to the severe laws of the intellect, in order to
generate in himself that co-ordination of freedom and law, that
involution of obedience in the prescript, and of the prescript in
the impulse to obey, which assimilates him to nature, and enables
him to understand her. He merely absents himself for a season
from her, that his own spirit, which has the same ground with
nature, may learn her unspoken language in its main radicals,
before he approaches to her endless compositions of them. Yes,
not to acquire cold notions &shy; lifeless technical rules &shy;
but living and life-producing ideas, which shall contain their
own evidence, the certainty that they are essentially one with
the germinal causes in nature &shy; his consciousness being the
focus and mirror of both, &shy; for this does the artist for a
time abandon the external real in order to return to it with a
complete sympathy with its internal and actual. For of all we
see, hear, feel and touch the substance is and must be in
ourselves; and therefore there is no alternative in reason
between the dreary (and thank heaven! almost impossible) belief
that every thing around us is but a phantom, or that the life
which is in us is in them likewise; and that to know is to
resemble, when we speak of objects out of ourselves, even as
within ourselves to learn is, according to Plato, only to
recollect; &shy; the only effective answer to which, that I have
been fortunate to meet with, is that which Pope has consecrated
for future use in the line &shy;<br>
</p>

<blockquote>And coxcombs vanquish Berkeley with a
grin!</blockquote>

<br>
<br>
<br>
 The artist must imitate that which is within the thing, that
which is active through form and figure, and discourses to us by
symbols &shy; the <i>Natur-geist</i>, or spirit of nature, as we
unconsciously imitate those whom we love; for so only can he hope
to produce any work truly natural in the object and truly human
in the effect. The idea which puts the form together cannot
itself be the form. It is above form, and is its essence, the
universal in the individual, or the individuality itself, &shy;
the glance and the exponent of the indwelling power.<br>
<br>
Each thing that lives has its moment of self-exposition, and so
has each period of each thing, if we remove the disturbing forces
of accident. To do this is the business of ideal art, whether in
images of childhood, youth, or age, in man or in woman. Hence a
good portrait is the abstract of the personal; it is not the
likeness for actual comparison, but for recollection. This
explains why the likeness of a very good portrait is not always
recognized; because some persons never abstract, and amongst
these are especially to be numbered the near relations and
friends of the subject, in consequence of the constant pressure
and check exercised on their minds by the actual presence of the
original. And each thing that only appears to live has also its
possible position of relation to life, as nature herself
testifies, who, where she cannot be, prophecies her being in the
crystallized metal, or the inhaling plant.<br>
<br>
The charm, the indispensable requisite, of sculpture is unity of
effect. But painting rests in a material remoter from nature, and
its compass is therefore greater. Light and shade give external,
as well internal, being even with all its accidents, whilst
sculpture is confined to the latter. And here I may observe that
the subjects chosen for works of art, whether in sculpture or
painting, should be such as really are capable of being expressed
and conveyed within the limits of those arts. Moreover they ought
to be such as will affect the spectator by their truth, their
beauty, or their sublimity, and therefore they may be addressed
to the judgment, the senses, or the reason. The peculiarity of
the impression which they may make, may be derived either from
colour and form, or from proportion and fitness, or from the
excitement of the moral feelings; or all these maybe combined.
Such works as do combine these sources of effect must have the
preference in dignity.<br>
<br>
Imitation of the antique may be too exclusive, and may produce an
injurious effect on modern sculpture; &shy; 1st, generally,
because such an imitation cannot fail to have a tendency to keep
the attention fixed on externals rather than on the thought
within; &shy; 2ndly, because, accordingly, it leads the artist to
rest satisfied with that which is always imperfect, namely,
bodily form, and circumscribes his views of mental expression to
the ideas of power and grandeur only; &shy; 3rdly, because it
induces an effort to combine together two incongruous things,
that is to say, modern feelings in antique forms; &shy; 4thly,
because it speaks in a language, as it were, learned and dead,
the tones of which, being unfamiliar, leave the common spectator
cold and unimpressed; &shy; and lastly, because it necessarily
causes a neglect of thoughts, emotions and images of profounder
interest and more exalted dignity, as motherly, sisterly, and
brotherly love, piety, devotion, the divine become human, &shy;
the Virgin, the Apostle, the Christ. The artist's principle in
the statue of a great man should be the illustration of departed
merit; and I cannot but think that a skilful adoption of modern
habiliments would, in many instances, give a variety and force of
effect which a bigotted adherence to Greek or Roman costume
precludes. It is, I believe, from artists finding Greek models
unfit for several important modern purposes, that we see so many
allegorical figures on monuments and elsewhere. Painting was, as
it were, a new art, and being unshackled by old models it chose
its own subjects, and took an eagle's flight. And a new field
seems opened for modern sculpture in the symbolical expression of
the ends of life, as in Guy's monument, Chantrey's children in
Worcester Cathedral, &amp;c.<br>
<br>
Architecture exhibits the greatest extent of the difference from
nature which may exist in works of art. It involves all the
powers of design, and is sculpture and painting inclusively. It
shews the greatness of man, and should at the same time teach him
humility.<br>
<br>
Music is the most entirely human of the fine arts, and has the
fewest <i>analoga</i> in nature. Its first delightfulness is
simple accordance with the ear; but it is an associated thing,
and recalls the deep emotions of the past with an intellectual
sense of proportion. Every human feeling is greater and larger
than the exciting cause, &shy; a proof, I think, that man is
designed for a higher state of existence; and this is deeply
implied in music in which there is always something more and
beyond the immediate expression.<br>
<br>
With regard to works in all the branches of the fine arts, I may
remark that the pleasure arising from novelty must of course be
allowed its due place and weight. This pleasure consists in the
identity of two opposite elements, that is to say &shy; sameness
and variety. If in the midst of the variety there be not some
fixed object for the attention, the unceasing succession of the
variety will prevent the mind from observing the difference of
the individual objects; and the only thing remaining will be the
succession, which will then produce precisely the same effect as
sameness. This we experience when we let the trees or hedges pass
before the fixed eye during a rapid movement in a carriage, or on
the other hand, when we suffer a file of soldiers or ranks of men
in procession to go on before us without resting the eye on any
one in particular. In order to derive pleasure from the
occupation of the mind, the principle of unity must always be
present, so that in the midst of the multeity the centripetal
force be never suspended, nor the sense be fatigued by the
predominance of the centrifugal force. This unity in multeity I
have elsewhere stated as the principle of beauty. It is equally
the source of pleasure in variety, and in fact a higher term
including both. What is the seclusive or distinguishing term
between them?<br>
<br>
Remember that there is a difference between form as proceeding,
and shape as superinduced; &shy; the latter is either the death
or the imprisonment of the thing; &shy; the former is its
self-witnessing and self-effected sphere of agency. Art would or
should be the abridgment of nature. Now the fulness of nature is
without character, as water is purest when without taste, smell,
or colour; but this is the highest, the apex only, &shy; it is
not the whole. The object of art is to give the whole <i>ad
hominem</i>; hence each step of nature hath its ideal, and hence
the possibility of a climax up to the perfect form of a
harmonized chaos.<br>
<br>
To the idea of life victory or strife is necessary; as virtue
consists not simply in the absence of vices, but in the
overcoming of them. So it is in beauty. The sight of what is
subordinated and conquered heightens the strength and the
pleasure; and this should be exhibited by the artist either
inclusively in his figure, or else out of it and beside it to act
by way of supplement and contrast. And with a view to this,
remark the seeming identity of body and mind in infants, and
thence the loveliness of the former; the commencing separation in
boyhood, and the struggle of equilibrium in youth: thence onward
the body is first simply indifferent; then demanding the
translucency of the mind not to be worse than indifferent; and
finally all that presents the body as body becoming almost of an
excremental nature.

<h3><a name="section48">Lecture XIV &shy; on Style</a></h3>

<p>I have, I believe, formerly observed with regard to the
character of the governments of the East, that their tendency was
despotic, that is, towards unity; whilst that of the Greek
governments, on the other hand, leaned to the manifold and the
popular, the unity in them being purely ideal, namely of all as
an identification of the whole. In the northern or Gothic nations
the aim and purpose of the government were the preservation of
the rights and interests of the individual in conjunction with
those of the whole. The individual interest was sacred. In the
character and tendency of the Greek and Gothic languages there is
precisely the same relative difference. In Greek the sentences
are long, and the structure architectural, so that each part or
clause is insignificant when compared with the whole. The result
is every thing, the steps and processes nothing. But in the
Gothic and, generally, in what we call the modern, languages, the
structure is short, simple, and complete in each part, and the
connexion of the parts with the sum total of the discourse is
maintained by the sequency of the logic, or the community of
feelings excited between the writer and his readers. As an
instance equally delightful and complete, of what may be called
the Gothic structure as contra-distinguished from that of the
Greeks, let me cite a part of our famous Chaucer's character of a
parish priest as he should be. Can it ever be quoted too
often?<br>

<br>
 Such change as really took place in the style of our literature
after Chaucer's time is with difficulty perceptible, on account
of the dearth of writers, during the civil wars of the l5th
century. But the transition was not very great; and accordingly
we find in Latimer and our other venerable authors about the time
of Edward VI. as in Luther, the general characteristics of the
earliest manner; &shy; that is, every part popular, and the
discourse addressed to all degrees of intellect; &shy; the
sentences short, the tone vehement, and the connexion of the
whole produced by honesty and singleness of purpose, intensity of
passion, and pervading importance of the subject.<br>
<br>
Another and a very different species of style is that which was
derived from, and founded on, the admiration and cultivation of
the classical writers, and which was more exclusively addressed
to the learned class in society. I have previously mentioned
Boccaccio as the original Italian introducer of this manner, and
the great models of it in English are Hooker, Bacon, Milton, and
Taylor, although it may be traced in many other authors of that
age. In all these the language is dignified but plain, genuine
English, although elevated and brightened by superiority of
intellect in the writer. Individual words themselves are always
used by them in their precise meaning, without either affectation
or slipslop. The letters and state papers of Sir Francis
Walsingham are remarkable for excellence in style of this
description. In Jeremy Taylor the sentences are often extremely
long, and yet are generally so perspicuous in consequence of
their logical structure, that they require no reperusal to be
understood; and it is for the most part the same in Milton and
Hooker.<br>
<br>
Take the following sentence as a specimen of the sort of style to
which I have been alluding:&shy; <br>


<blockquote>Concerning Faith, the principal object whereof is
that eternal verity which hath discovered the treasures of hidden
wisdom in Christ; concerning Hope, the highest object whereof is
that everlasting goodness which in Christ doth quicken the dead;
concerning Charity, the final object whereof is that
incomprehensible beauty which shineth in the countenance of
Christ, the Son of the living God: concerning these virtues, the
first of which beginning here with a weak apprehension of things
not seen, endeth with the intuitive vision of God in the world to
come; the second beginning here with a trembling expectation of
things far removed, and as yet but only heard of, endeth with
real and actual fruition of that which no tongue can express; the
third beginning here with a weak inclination of heart towards him
unto whom we are not able to approach, endeth with endless union,
the mystery whereof is higher than the reach of the thoughts of
men; concerning that Faith, Hope, and Charity, without which
there can be no salvation, was there ever any mention made saving
only in that Law which God himself hath from Heaven revealed?
There is not in the world a syllable muttered with certain truth
concerning any of these three, more than hath been supernaturally
received from the mouth of the eternal God.<br>
 Eccles. <i>Pol.</i> I. s. 11.</blockquote>

<br>
 The unity in these writers is produced by the unity of the
subject, and the perpetual growth and evolution of the thoughts,
one generating, and explaining, and justifying, the place of
another, not, as it is in Seneca, where the thoughts, striking as
they are, are merely strung together like beads, without any
causation or progression. The words are selected because they are
the most appropriate, regard being had to the dignity of the
total impression, and no merely big phrases are used where plain
ones would have sufficed, even in the most learned of their
works.<br>
<br>
There is some truth in a remark, which I believe was made by Sir
Joshua Reynolds, that the greatest man is he who forms the taste
of a nation, and that the next greatest is he who corrupts it.
The true classical style of Hooker and his fellows was easily
open to corruption; and Sir Thomas Brown it was, who, though a
writer of great genius, first effectually injured the literary
taste of the nation by his introduction of learned words, merely
because they were learned. It would be difficult to describe
Brown adequately; exuberant in conception and conceit, dignified,
hyperlatinistic, a quiet and sublime enthusiast; yet a fantast, a
humourist, a brain with a twist; egotistic like Montaigne, yet
with a feeling heart and an active curiosity, which, however, too
often degenerates into a hunting after oddities. In his
<i>Hydriotaphia</i> and, indeed, almost all his works the
entireness of his mental action is very observable; he
metamorphoses every thing, be it what it may, into the subject
under consideration. But Sir Thomas Brown with all his faults had
a genuine idiom; and it is the existence of an individual idiom
in each, that makes the principal writers before the Restoration
the great patterns or integers of English style. In them the
precise intended meaning of a word can never be mistaken; whereas
in the later writers, as especially in Pope, the use of words is
for the most part purely arbitrary, so that the context will
rarely show the true specific sense, but only that something of
the sort is designed. A perusal of the authorities cited by
Johnson in his dictionary under any leading word, will give you a
lively sense of this declension in etymological truth of
expression in the writers after the Restoration, or perhaps,
strictly, after the middle of the reign of Charles II.<br>
<br>
The general characteristic of the style of our literature down to
the period which I have just mentioned, was gravity, and in
Milton and some other writers of his day there are perceptible
traces of the sternness of republicanism. Soon after the
Restoration a material change took place, and the cause of
royalism was graced, sometimes disgraced, by every shade of
lightness of manner. A free and easy style was considered as a
test of loyalty, or at all events, as a badge of the cavalier
party; you may detect it occasionally even in Barrow, who is,
however, in general remarkable for dignity and logical sequency
of expression; but in L'Estrange, Collyer, and the writers of
that class, this easy manner was carried out to the utmost
extreme of slang and ribaldry. Yet still the works, even of these
last authors, have considerable merit in one point of view; their
language is level to the understandings of all men; it is an
actual transcript of the colloquialism of the day, and is
accordingly full of life and reality. Roger North's life of his
brother the Lord Keeper, is the most valuable specimen of this
class of our literature; it is delightful, and much beyond any
other of the writings of his contemporaries.<br>
<br>
From the common opinion that the English style attained its
greatest perfection in and about Queen Ann's reign I altogether
dissent; not only because it is in one species alone in which it
can be pretended that the writers of that age excelled their
predecessors, but also because the specimens themselves are not
equal, upon sound principles of judgment, to much that had been
produced before. The classical structure of Hooker &shy; the
impetuous, thought-agglomerating, flood of Taylor &shy; to these
there is no pretence of a parallel; and for mere ease and grace,
is Cowley inferior to Addison, being as he is so much more
thoughtful and full of fancy? Cowley, with the omission of a
quaintness here and there, is probably the best model of style
for modern imitation in general. Taylor's periods have been
frequently attempted by his admirers; you may, perhaps, just
catch the turn of a simile or single image, but to write in the
real manner of Jeremy Taylor would require as mighty a mind as
his. Many parts of Algernon Sidney's treatises afford excellent
exemplars of a good modern practical style; and Dryden in his
prose works, is a still better model, if you add a stricter and
purer grammar. It is, indeed, worthy of remark that all our great
poets have been good prose writers, as Chaucer, Spenser, Milton;
and this probably arose from their just sense of metre. For a
true poet will never confound verse and prose; whereas it is
almost characteristic of indifferent prose writers that they
should be constantly slipping into scraps of metre. Swift's style
is, in its line, perfect; the manner is a complete expression of
the matter, the terms appropriate, and the artifice concealed. It
is simplicity in the true sense of the word.<br>
<br>
After the Revolution, the spirit of the nation became much more
commercial, than it had been before; a learned body, or clerisy,
as such, gradually disappeared, and literature in general began
to be addressed to the common miscellaneous public. That public
had become accustomed to, and required, a strong stimulus; and to
meet the requisitions of the public taste, a style was produced
which by combining triteness of thought with singularity and
excess of manner of expression, was calculated at once to soothe
ignorance and to flatter vanity. The thought was carefully kept
down to the immediate apprehension of the commonest
understanding, and the dress was as anxiously arranged for the
purpose of making the thought appear something very profound. The
essence of this style consisted in a mock antithesis, that is, an
opposition of mere sounds, in a rage for personification, the
abstract made animate, far-fetched metaphors, strange phrases,
metrical scraps, in every thing, in short, but genuine prose.
Style is, of course, nothing else but the art of conveying the
meaning appropriately and with perspicuity, whatever that meaning
may be, and one criterion of style is that it shall not be
translateable without injury to the meaning. Johnson's style has
pleased many from the very fault of being perpetually
translateable; he creates an impression of cleverness by never
saying any thing in a common way. The best specimen of this
manner is in Junius, because his antithesis is less merely verbal
than Johnson's. Gibbon's manner is the worst of all; it has every
fault of which this peculiar style is capable. Tacitus is an
example of it in Latin; in coming from Cicero you feel the
<i>falsetto</i> immediately.<br>
<br>
In order to form a good style, the primary rule and condition is,
not to attempt to express ourselves in language before we
thoroughly know our own meaning; &shy; when a man perfectly
understands himself, appropriate diction will generally be at his
command either in writing or speaking. In such cases the thoughts
and the words are associated. In the next place preciseness in
the use of terms is required, and the test is whether you can
translate the phrase adequately into simpler terms, regard being
had to the feeling of the whole passage. Try this upon
Shakspeare, or Milton, and see if you can substitute other
simpler words in any given passage without a violation of the
meaning or tone. The source of bad writing is the desire to be
something more than a man of sense, &shy; the straining to be
thought a genius; and it is just the same in speech making. If
men would only say what they have to say in plain terms, how much
more eloquent they would be! Another rule is to avoid converting
mere abstractions into persons. I believe you will very rarely
find in any great writer before the Revolution the possessive
case of an inanimate noun used in prose instead of the dependent
case, as 'the watch's hand,' for 'the hand of the watch.' The
possessive or Saxon genitive was confined to persons, or at least
to animated subjects. And I cannot conclude this Lecture without
insisting on the importance of accuracy of style as being near
akin to veracity and truthful habits of mind; he who thinks
loosely will write loosely, and, perhaps, there is some moral
inconvenience in the common forms of our grammars which give
children so many obscure terms for material distinctions. Let me
also exhort you to careful examination of what you read, if it be
worth any perusal at all; such examination will be a safeguard
from fanaticism, the universal origin of which is in the
contemplation of phenomena without investigation into their
causes. <br>

<a name="f1gr">Notes on Sir Thomas Brown's <i>Religio Medici</i></a>
<a href="#f1g">1</a>
</h2>

<p>Strong feeling and an active intellect conjoined, lead almost
necessarily, in the first stage of philosophising, to Spinosism.
Sir T. Brown was a Spinosist without knowing it.<br>
<br>
If I have not quite all the faith that the author of the
<i>Religio Medici</i> possessed, I have all the inclination to
it; it gives me pleasure to believe.<br>
<br>
The postscript at the very end of the book is well worth reading.
Sir K. Digby's observations, however, are those of a pedant in
his own system and opinion. He ought to have considered the <i>R.
M.</i> in a dramatic, and not in a metaphysical, view, as a sweet
exhibition of character and passion, and not as an expression, or
investigation, of positive truth. The <i>R. M.</i> is a fine
portrait of a handsome man in his best clothes; it is much of
what he was at all times, a good deal of what he was only in his
best moments. I have never read a book in which I felt greater
similarity to my own make of mind &shy; active in inquiry, and
yet with an appetite to believe &shy; in short an affectionate
visionary! But then I should tell a different tale of my own
heart; for I would not only endeavour to tell the truth, (which I
doubt not Sir T. B. has done), but likewise to tell the whole
truth, which most assuredly he has not done. However, it is a
most delicious book. His own character was a fine mixture of
humourist, genius, and pedant. A library was a living world to
him, and every book a man, absolute flesh and blood! and the
gravity with which he records contradictory opinions is
exquisite.<br>
</p>

<blockquote>(Part 1. sect. 9.)<br>
 Now contrarily, I bless myself, and am thankful that I lived not
in the days of miracles, that I never saw Christ nor his
disciples, &amp;c.</blockquote>

<br>
 So say I.<br>


<blockquote>(S. 15.)<br>
 I could never content my contemplation with those general pieces
of wonder, the flux and reflux of the sea, the increase of Nile,
the conversion of the needle to the north; and have studied to
match and parallel those in the more obvious and neglected pieces
of nature; which without further travel I can do in the
cosmography of myself; we carry with us the wonders we seek
without us. There is all Africa and her prodigies in us; we are
that bold and adventurous piece of nature, which he that studies
wisely learns in a <i>compendium</i> what others labour at in a
divided piece and endless volume.</blockquote>

<br>
 This is the true characteristic of genius; our destiny and
instinct is to unriddle the world, and he is the man of genius
who feels this instinct fresh and strong in his nature; who
perceiving the riddle and the mystery of all things even the
commonest, needs no strange and out-of-the-way tales or images to
stimulate him into wonder and a deep interest.<br>


<blockquote>(S. 16, 17.)<br>
 All this is very fine philosophy, and the best and most
ingenious defence of revelation. Moreover, I do hold and believe
that a toad is a comely animal; but nevertheless a toad is called
ugly by almost all men, and it is the business of a philosopher
to explain the reason of this.</blockquote>

<br>
 S. 19. This is exceedingly striking. Had Sir T. B. lived
now-a-days, he would probably have been a very ingenious and bold
infidel in his real opinions, though the kindness of his nature
would have kept him aloof from vulgar prating obtrusive
infidelity.<br>
<br>
S. 35. An excellent burlesque on parts of the Schoolmen, though I
believe an unintentional one.<br>
<br>
S. 36. Truly sublime &shy; and in Sir T. B.'s very best
manner.<br>
<br>
S. 39. This is a most admirable passage. Yes, &shy; the history
of a man for the nine months preceding his birth, would,
probably, be far more interesting, and contain events of greater
moment than all the three score and ten years that follow it.<br>


<blockquote>(S. 48.)<br>
 This is made good by experience, which can from the ashes of a
plant revive the plant, and from its cinders recall it into its
stalks and leaves again.</blockquote>

<br>
 Stuff. This was, I believe, some lying boast of Paracelsus,
which the good Sir T. B. has swallowed for a fact.<br>


<blockquote>(Part II. s. 2.)<br>
 I give no alms to satisfy the hunger of my brother, but to
fulfil and accomplish the will and command of my
God.</blockquote>

<br>
 We ought not to relieve a poor man merely because our own
feelings impel us, but because these feelings are just and proper
feelings. My feelings might impel me to revenge with the same
force with which they urge me to charity. I must therefore have
some rule by which I may judge my feelings, &shy; and this rule
is God's will.<br>


<blockquote>(S. 5, 6.)<br>
 I never yet cast a true affection on a woman; but I have loved
my friend as I do virtue, my soul, my God.</blockquote>

<br>
 We cannot love a friend as a woman; but we may love a woman as a
friend. Friendship satisfies the highest parts of our nature; but
a wife, who is capable of friendship, satisfies all. The great
business of real unostentatious virtue is &shy; not to eradicate
any genuine instinct or appetite of human nature; but &shy; to
establish a concord and unity betwixt all parts of our nature, to
give a feeling and a passion to our purer intellect, and to
intellectualize our feelings and passions. This a happy marriage,
blest with children, effectuates in the highest degree, of which
our nature is capable, and is therefore chosen by St. Paul as the
symbol of the union of the church with Christ; that is, of the
souls of all good men with God. "I scarcely distinguish," said
once a good old man, "the wife of my old age from the wife of my
youth; for when we were both young, and she was beautiful, for
once that I caressed her with a meaner passion, I caressed her a
thousand times with love &shy; and these caresses still remain to
us." Besides, there is another reason why friendship is of
somewhat less value than love, which includes friendship, it is
this &shy; we may love many persons, all very dearly; but we
cannot love many persons all equally dearly. There will be
differences, there will be gradations. But our nature imperiously
asks a summit, a resting-place; it is with the affections in love
as with the reason in religion, we cannot diffuse and equalize;
we must have a supreme, a one, the highest. What is more common
than to say of a man in love, 'he idolizes her,' 'he makes a god
of her?' Now, in order that a person should continue to love
another better than all others, it seems necessary, that this
feeling should be reciprocal. For if it be not so, sympathy is
broken off in the very highest point. A. (we will say by way of
illustration) loves B. above all others, in the best and fullest
sense of the word, love, but B. loves C. above all others.
Either, therefore, A. does not sympathize with B. in this most
important feeling; and then his love must necessarily be
incomplete, and accompanied with a craving after something that
is not, and yet might be; or he does sympathize with B. in loving
C. above all others &shy; and then, of course, he loves C. better
than B. Now it is selfishness, at least it seems so to me, to
desire that your friend should love you better than all others
&shy; but not to wish that a wife should.<br>


<blockquote>(S. 6.)<br>
Another misery there is in affection, that whom we truly love
like ourselves, we forget their looks, nor can our memory retain
the idea of their faces; and it is no wonder: for they are
ourselves, and our affection makes their looks our
own.</blockquote>

<br>
 A thought I have often had, and once expressed it in almost the
same language. The fact is certain, but the explanation here
given is very unsatisfactory. For why do we never have an image
of our own faces &shy; an image of fancy, I mean?<br>


<blockquote>(S. 7.)<br>
 I can hold there is no such thing as injury; that if there be,
there is no such injury as revenge, and no such revenge as the
contempt of an injury; that to hate another, is to malign
himself, and that the truest way to love another is to despise
ourselves.</blockquote>

<br>
 I thank God that I can, with a full and unfeigning heart, utter
Amen to this passage.<br>


<blockquote>(S. 10.)<br>
 In brief, there can be nothing truly alone, and by itself, which
is not truly one; and such is only God.</blockquote>

<br>
 Reciprocity is that which alone gives stability to love. It is
not mere selfishness that impels all kind natures to desire that
there should be some one human being, to whom they are most dear.
It is because they wish some one being to exist, who shall be the
resting place and summit of their love; and this in human nature
is not possible, unless the two affections coincide. The reason
is, that the object of the highest love will not otherwise be the
same in both parties.<br>


<blockquote>(S. 11.)<br>
 I thank God for my happy dreams, &amp;c.</blockquote>

<br>
 I am quite different from Sir T. B. in this; for all, or almost
all, the painful and fearful thoughts that I know, are in my
dreams; &shy; so much so, that when I am wounded by a friend, or
receive an unpleasant letter, it throws me into a state very
nearly resembling that of a dream.<br>


<blockquote>(S. 13.)<br>
 Statists that labour to contrive a commonwealth without any
poverty, take away the object of our charity, not only not
understanding the commonwealth of a Christian, but forgetting the
prophecies of Christ.</blockquote>

<br>
 O, for shame! for shame! Is there no fit object of charity but
abject poverty? And what sort of a charity must that be which
wishes misery in order that it may have the credit of relieving a
small part of it, &shy; pulling down the comfortable cottages of
independent industry to build alms-houses out of the ruins! This
book paints certain parts of my moral and intellectual being,
(the best parts, no doubt,) better than any other book I have
ever met with; &shy; and the style is throughout delicious.<br>

</p>

<blockquote><i>Stat nominis umbra.</i></blockquote>

<br>
 As he never dropped the mask, so he too often used the poisoned
dagger of an assassin.<br>


<blockquote><i>Dedication to the English nation</i>.</blockquote>

<br>
 The whole of this dedication reads like a string of aphorisms
arranged in chapters, and classified by a resemblance of subject,
or a cento of points.<br>


<blockquote>(<i>Ib.</i>)<br>
 If an honest, and I may truly affirm a laborious, zeal for the
public service has given me any weight in your esteem, let me
exhort and conjure you never to suffer an invasion of your
political constitution, however minute the instance may appear,
to pass by, without a determined persevering
resistance.</blockquote>

<br>
 A longer sentence and proportionately inelegant.<br>
<br>
<blockquote>(<i>Ib.</i>)<br>
 If you reflect that in the changes of administration which have
marked and disgraced the present reign, although your warmest
patriots have, in their turn, been invested with the lawful and
unlawful authority of the crown, and though other reliefs or
improvements have been held forth to the people, yet that no one
man in office has ever promoted or encouraged a bill for
shortening the duration of parliaments, but that (whoever was
minister) the opposition to this measure, ever since the
septennial act passed, has been constant and uniform on the part
of government.</blockquote>

<br>
 Long, and as usual, inelegant. Junius cannot manage a long
sentence; it has all the <i>ins</i> and <i>outs</i> of a snappish
figure-dance.<br>


<blockquote>Preface</blockquote>

<br>
<br>
An excellent preface, and the sentences not so snipt as in the
dedication. The paragraph near the conclusion beginning with
"some opinion may now be expected," &amp;c. and ending with "relation
between guilt and punishment," deserves to be quoted as a
master-piece of rhetorical ratiocination in a series of questions
that permit no answer; or (as Junius says) carry their own answer
along with them. The great art of Junius is never to say too
much, and to avoid with equal anxiety a commonplace manner, and
matter that is not commonplace. If ever he deviates into any
originality of thought, he takes care that it shall be such as
excites surprise for its acuteness, rather than admiration for
its profundity. He takes care? say rather, that nature took care
for him. It is impossible to detract from the merit of these
Letters: they are suited to their purpose, and perfect in their
kind. They impel to action, not thought. Had they been profound
or subtle in thought, or majestic and sweeping in composition,
they would have been adapted for the closet of a Sidney, or for a
House of Lords such as it was in the time of Lord Bacon; but they
are plain and sensible whenever the author is in the right, and
whether right or wrong, always shrewd and epigrammatic, and
fitted for the coffee-house, the exchange, the lobby of the House
of Commons, and to be read aloud at a public meeting. When
connected, dropping the forms of connection, desultory without
abruptness or appearance of disconnection, epigrammatic and
antithetical to excess, sententious and personal, regardless of
right or wrong, yet well-skilled to act the part of an honest
warm-hearted man, and even when he is in the right, saying the
truth but never proving it, much less attempting to bottom it,
&shy; this is the character of Junius; &shy; and on this
character, and in the mould of these writings must every man cast
himself, who would wish in factious times to be the important and
long remembered agent of a faction. I believe that I could do all
that Junius has done, and surpass him by doing many things which
he has not done: for example, &shy; by an occasional induction of
startling facts, in the manner of Tom Paine, and lively
illustrations and witty applications of good stories and
appropriate anecdotes in the manner of Horne Tooke. I believe I
could do it if it were in my nature to aim at this sort of
excellence, or to be enamoured of the fame, and immediate
influence, which would be its consequence and reward. But it is
not in my nature. I not only love truth, but I have a passion for
the legitimate investigation of truth. The love of truth
conjoined with a keen delight in a strict and skillful yet
impassioned argumentation, is my master-passion, and to it are
subordinated even the love of liberty and all my public feelings
&shy; and to it whatever I labour under of vanity, ambition, and
all my inward impulses.<br>
<br>
<i>Letter I.</i> From this Letter all the faults and excellencies
of Junius may be exemplified. The moral and political aphorisms
are just and sensible, the irony in which his personal satire is
conveyed is fine, yet always intelligible; but it approaches too
nearly to the nature of a sneer; the sentences are cautiously
constructed without the forms of connection; the <i>he</i> and
<i>it</i> everywhere substituted for the <i>who</i> and
<i>which</i>; the sentences are short, laboriously balanced, and
the antitheses stand the test of analysis much better than
Johnson's. These are all excellencies in their kind; &shy; where
is the defect? In this; &shy; there is too much of each, and
there is a defect of many things, the presence of which would
have been not only valuable for their own sakes, but for the
relief and variety which they would have given. It is observable
too that every Letter adds to the faults of these Letters, while
it weakens the effect of their beauties.<br>
<br>
<i>L. III</i>. A capital letter, addressed to a private person,
and intended as a sharp reproof for intrusion. Its short
sentences, its witty perversions and deductions, its questions
and omissions of connectives, all in their proper places, are
dramatically good.<br>


<blockquote>(L. V.)<br>
 For my own part, I willingly leave it to the public to determine
whether your vindication of your friend has been as able and
judicious as it was certainly well intended; and you, I think,
may be satisfied with the warm acknowledgements he already owes
you for making him the principal figure in a piece in which, but
for your amicable assistance, he might have passed without
particular notice or distinction.</blockquote>

<br>
 A long sentence and, as usual, inelegant and cumbrous. This
Letter is a faultless composition with exception of the one long
sentence.<br>


<blockquote>(L. VII.)<br>
 These are the gloomy companions of a disturbed
<i>imagination</i>; the melancholy madness of poetry, without the
<i>inspiration</i>.</blockquote>

<br>
 The rhyme is a fault. 'Fancy' had been better; though but for
the rhyme, imagination is the fitter word.<br>


<blockquote>(<i>Ib.</i>)<br>
 Such a question might perhaps discompose the gravity of his
muscles, but I believe it would little affect the tranquillity of
his conscience.</blockquote>

<br>
 A false antithesis, a mere verbal balance; there are far, far
too many of these. However, with these few exceptions, this
Letter is a blameless composition. Junius may be safely studied
as a model for letters where he truly writes letters. Those to
the Duke of Grafton and others, are small pamphlets in the form
of letters.<br>


<blockquote>(L. VIII)<br>
 To do justice to your Grace's humanity, you felt for Mac Quick
as you ought to do; and, if you had been contented to assist him
indirectly, without a notorious denial of justice, or openly
insulting the sense of the nation, you might have satisfied every
duty of political friendship, without committing the honour of
your sovereign, or hazarding the reputation of his
government.</blockquote>

<br>
 An inelegant cluster of <i>withouts</i>. Junius asks questions
incomparably well; &shy; but <i>ne quid nimis</i>.<br>
<br>
L. IX. Perhaps the fair way of considering these Letters would be
as a kind of satirical poems; the short, and for ever balanced,
sentences constitute a true metre; and the connection is that of
satiric poetry, a witty logic, an association of thoughts by
amusing semblances of cause and effect, the sophistry of which
the reader has an interest in not stopping to detect, for it
flatters his love of mischief, and makes the sport.<br>
<br>
L. XII. One of Junius's arts, and which gives me a high notion of
his genius, as a poet and satirist, is this:&shy; he takes for
granted the existence of a character that never did and never can
exist, and then employs his wit, and surprises and amuses his
readers with analyzing its incompatibilities.<br>
<br>
L. XIV. Continual sneer, continual irony, all excellent, if it
were not for the ' all;' &shy; but a countenance, with a
malignant smile in statuary fixure on it, becomes at length an
object of aversion, however beautiful the face, and however
beautiful the smile. We are relieved, in some measure, from this
by frequent just and well expressed moral aphorisms; but then the
preceding and following irony gives them the appearance of
proceeding from the head, not from the heart. This objection
would be less felt, when the Letters were first published at
considerable intervals; but Junius wrote for posterity.<br>
<br>
L. XXIII. Sneer and irony continued with such gross violation of
good sense, as to be perfectly nonsense. The man who can address
another on his most detestable vices in a strain of cold
continual irony, is himself a wretch.<br>


<blockquote>(L. XXXV.)<br>
 To honour them with a determined predilection and confidence in
exclusion of your English subjects, who placed your family, and,
in spite of treachery and rebellion, have supported it upon the
throne, is a mistake too gross even for the unsuspecting
generosity of youth.</blockquote>

<br>
 The words ' upon the throne', stand unfortunately for the
harmonious effect of the balance of' placed' and '
supported.'<br>
<br>
This address to the king is almost faultless in composition, and
has been evidently tormented with the file. But it has fewer
beauties than any other long letter of Junius; and it is utterly
undramatic. There is nothing in the style, the transitions, or
the sentiments, which represents the passions of a man
emboldening himself to address his sovereign personally. Like a
Presbyterian's prayer, you may substitute almost every where the
third for the second person without injury. The newspaper, his
closet, and his own person were alone present to the author's
intention and imagination. This makes the composition vapid. It
possesses an Isocratic correctness, when it should have had the
force and drama of an oration of Demosthenes. From this, however,
the paragraph beginning with the words "As to the Scotch," and
also the last two paragraphs must be honourably excepted. They
are, perhaps, the finest passages in the whole collection. <br>

<p>1803.<br>
<br>
Heaven forbid that this work should not exist in its present form
and language! Yet I cannot avoid the wish that it had, during the
reign of James I., been moulded into an heroic poem in English
octave stanza, or epic blank verse; &shy; which, however, at that
time had not been invented, and which, alas! still remains the
sole property of the inventor, as if the Muses had given him an
unevadible patent for it. Of dramatic blank verse we have many
and various specimens; &shy; for example, Shakspeare's as
compared with Massinger's, both excellent in their kind:&shy; of
lyric, and of what may be called Orphic, or philosophic, blank
verse, perfect models may be found in Wordsworth: of colloquial
blank verse there are excellent, though not perfect, examples in
Cowper; &shy; but of epic blank verse, since Milton, there is not
one.<br>
<br>
It absolutely distresses me when I reflect that this work,
admired as it has been by great men of all ages, and lately, I
hear, by the poet Cowper, should be only not unknown to general
readers. It has been translated into English two or three times
&shy; how, I know not, wretchedly, I doubt not. It affords matter
for thought that the last translation (or rather, in all
probability, miserable and faithless abridgment of some former
one) was given under another name. What a mournful proof of the
incelebrity of this great and amazing work among both the public
and the people! For as Wordsworth, the greater of the two great
men of this age, &shy; (at least, except Davy and him, I have
known, read of, heard of, no others) &shy; for as Wordsworth did
me the honour of once observing to me, the people and the public
are two distinct classes, and, as things go, the former is likely
to retain a better taste, the less it is acted out by the latter.
Yet <i>Telemachus</i> is in every mouth, in every school-boy's
and school-girl's hand! It is awful to say of a work, like the
<i>Argenis</i>, the style and Latinity of which, judged (not
according to classical pedantry, which pronounces every sentence
right which can be found in any book prior to Boetius, however
vicious the age, or affected the author, and every sentence
wrong, however natural and beautiful, which has been of the
author's own combination, &shy; but, according to the universal
logic of thought as modified by feeling, is equal to that of
Tacitus in energy and genuine conciseness, and is as perspicuous
as that of Livy, whilst it is free from the affectations,
obscurities, and lust to surprise of the former, and seems a sort
of antithesis to the slowness and prolixity of the latter; &shy;
(this remark does not, however, impeach even the classicality of
the language, which, when the freedom and originality, the easy
motion and perfect command of the thoughts, are considered, is
truly wonderful:&shy; of such a work it is awful to say, that it
would have been well if it had been written in English or Italian
verse! Yet the event seems to justify the notion. Alas! it is now
too late. What modern work, even of the size of the <i>Paradise
Lost</i> &shy; much less of the <i>Faery Queene</i> &shy; would
be read in the present day, or even bought or be likely to be
bought, unless it were an instructive work, as the phrase is,
like Roscoe's quartos of <i>Leo X</i>., or entertaining like
Boswell's three of Dr. Johnson's conversations. It may be fairly
objected &shy; what work of surpassing merit has given the proof?
&shy; Certainly, none. Yet still there are ominous facts,
sufficient, I fear, to afford a certain prophecy of its
reception, if such were produced.<br>

<a name="f1ir">Notes on Chapman's Homer.</a></h2>

<p><i>extract of a letter sent with the volume
<a href="#f1i">1</a> 1807</i><br>
<br>
Chapman I have sent in order that you might read the
<i>Odyssey</i>; the <i>Iliad</i> is fine, but less equal in the
translation, as well as less interesting in itself. What is
stupidly said of Shakspeare, is really true and appropriate of
Chapman; mighty faults counterpoised by mighty beauties.
Excepting his quaint epithets which he affects to render
literally from the Greek, a language above all others blest in
the happy marriage of sweet words, and which in our language are
mere printer's compound epithets &shy; such as quaffed divine
<i>joy-in-the-heart-of-man-infusing</i> wine, (the undermarked is
to be one word, because one sweet mellifluous word expresses it
in Homer); &shy; excepting this, it has no look, no air, of a
translation. It is as truly an original poem as the <i>Faery
Queene</i>; &shy; it will give you small idea of Homer, though a
far truer one than Pope's epigrams, or Cowper's cumbersome most
anti-Homeric Miltonism. For Chapman writes and feels as a poet,
&shy; as Homer might have written had he lived in England in the
reign of Queen Elizabeth. In short, it is an exquisite poem, in
spite of its frequent and perverse quaintnesses and harshnesses,
which are, however, amply repaid by almost unexampled sweetness
and beauty of language, all over spirit and feeling. In the main
it is an English heroic poem, the tale of which is borrowed from
the Greek. The dedication to the <i>Iliad</i> is a noble copy of
verses, especially those sublime lines beginning, &shy;<br>
</p>

<blockquote>O!'tis wondrous much<br>
 (Though nothing prisde) that the right vertuous touch<br>
 Of a well written soule, to vertue moves.<br>
 Nor haue we soules to purpose, if their loves<br>
 Of fitting objects be not so inflam'd.<br>
 How much then, were this kingdome's maine soule maim'd,<br>
 To want this great inflamer of all powers<br>
 That move in humane soules! All realmes but yours,<br>
 Are honor'd with him; and hold blest that state<br>
 That have his workes to reade and contemplate.<br>
 In which, humanitie to her height is raisde;<br>
 Which all the world (yet, none enough) hath praisde.<br>
 Seas, earth, and heaven, he did in verse comprize;<br>
 Out sung the Muses, and did equalise<br>
 Their king Apollo; being so farre from cause<br>
 Of princes light thoughts, that their gravest lawes<br>
 May finde stuffe to be fashiond by his lines.<br>
 Through all the pompe of kingdomes still he shines<br>
 And graceth all his gracers. Then let lie<br>
 Your lutes, and viols, and more loftily<br>
 Make the heroiques of your Homer sung,<br>
 To drums and trumpets set his Angels tongue:<br>
 And with the princely sports of haukes you use,<br>
 Behold the kingly flight of his high Muse:<br>
 And see how like the Ph&ouml;enix she renues<br>
 Her age, and starrie feathers in your sunne;<br>
 Thousands of yeares attending; everie one<br>
 Blowing the holy fire, and throwing in<br>
 Their seasons, kingdomes, nations that have bin<br>
 Subverted in them; lawes, religions, all<br>
 Offerd to change, and greedie funerall;<br>
 Yet still your Homer lasting, living, raigning.

<br>
 and likewise the 1st, the 11th, and last but one, of the
prefatory sonnets to the <i>Odyssey</i>. Could I have foreseen
any other speedy opportunity, I should have begged your
acceptance of the volume in a somewhat handsomer coat; but as it
is, it will better represent the sender, &shy; to quote from
myself &shy; <br>


<blockquote><a name="f1jr"></a>A man disherited, in form and
face,<br>
 By nature and mishap, of outward grace. <a href=
"#f1j">2</a></blockquote>

<br>
 <a name="f1kr"></a>Chapman in his moral heroic verse, as in this
dedication and the prefatory sonnets to his <i>Odyssey</i>,
stands above Ben Jonson; there is more dignity, more lustre, and
equal strength; but not midway quite between him and the sonnets
of Milton. I do not know whether I give him the higher praise, in
that he reminds me of Ben Jonson with a sense of his superior
excellence, or that he brings Milton to memory notwithstanding
his inferiority. His moral poems are not quite out of books like
Jonson's, nor yet do the sentiments so wholly grow up out of his
own natural habit and grandeur of thought, as in Milton. The
sentiments have been attracted to him by a natural affinity of
his intellect, and so combined;-but Jonson has taken them by
individual and successive acts of choice. <a href=
"#f1k">3</a><br>
<br>
<a name="f1lr"></a>All this and the preceding is well felt and
vigorously, though harshly, expressed, respecting sublime poetry
<i>in genere</i>; but in reading Homer I look about me, and ask
how does all this apply here. For surely never was there plainer
writing; there are a thousand charms of sun and moonbeam, ripple,
and wave, and stormy billow, but all on the surface. Had Chapman
read Proclus and Porphyry? &shy; and did he really believe them,
&shy; or even that they believed themselves? They felt the
immense power of a <i>Bible</i>, a <i>Shaster</i>, a
<i>Koran</i>. There was none in Greece or Rome, and they tried
therefore by subtle allegorical accommodations to conjure the
poem of Homer into the

<a href="#f1l">4</a><br>
<br>
<a name="f1mr"></a>Chapman's identification of his fate with
Homer's, and his complete forgetfulness of the distinction
between Christianity and idolatry, under the general feeling of
some religion, is very interesting. It is amusing to observe, how
familiar Chapman's fancy has become with Homer, his life and its
circumstances, though the very existence of any such individual,
at l east with regard to the <i>Iliad</i> and the <i>Hymns</i>,
is more than problematic. N. B. The rude engraving in the page
was designed by no vulgar hand. It is full of spirit and passion.
<a href="#f1m">5</a> <br>
<br>
I am so dull, that neither in the original nor in any translation
could I ever find any wit or wise purpose in this poem. The whole
humour seems to lie in the names. The frogs and mice are not
frogs or mice, but men, and yet they do nothing that conveys any
satire. In the Greek there is much beauty of language, but the
joke is very flat. This is always the case in rude ages; &shy;
their serious vein is inimitable, &shy; their comic low and low
indeed. The psychological cause is easily stated, and copiously
exemplifiable.<br>

<h2><a name="section54">Note in Baxter's <i>Life of
Himself</i></a></h2>

<p>1820.<br>
<br>
Among the grounds for recommending the perusal of our elder
writers &shy; Hooker &shy; Taylor &shy; Baxter &shy; in short
almost any of the folios composed from Edward VI. to Charles II.
I note:<br>
<br>
<b>1.</b>  The overcoming the habit of deriving your whole
pleasure passively from the book itself, which can only be
effected by excitement of curiosity or of some passion. Force
yourself to reflect on what you read paragraph by paragraph, and
in a short time you will derive your pleasure, an ample portion
of it, at least, from the activity of your own mind. All else is
picture sunshine.<br>
<br>
<b>2.</b>  The conquest of party and sectarian prejudices, when
you have on the same table before you the works of a Hammond and
a Baxter, and reflect how many and how momentous their points of
agreement, how few and almost childish the differences, which
estranged and irritated these good men. Let us but imagine what
their blessed spirits now feel at the retrospect of their earthly
frailties, and can we do other than strive to feel as they now
feel, not as they once felt? So will it be with the disputes
between good men of the present day; and if you have no other
reason to doubt your opponent's goodness than the point in
dispute, think of Baxter and Hammond, of Milton and Taylor, and
let it be no reason at all.<br>
<br>
<b>3.</b>  It will secure you from the narrow idolatry of the
present times and fashions, and create the noblest kind of
imaginative power in your soul, that of living in past ages;
&shy; wholly devoid of which power, a man can neither anticipate
the future, nor ever live a truly human life, a life of reason in
the present.<br>
<br>
<b>4.</b>  In this particular work we may derive a most
instructive lesson, that in certain points, as of religion in
relation to law, the <i>medio tutis &shy; simus ibis</i> is
inapplicable. There is no 'medium' possible; and all the attempts
as those of Baxter, though no more were required than 'I believe
in God through Christ,' prove only the mildness of the proposer's
temper, but as a rule would be either equal to nothing, at least
exclude only the two or three in a century that make it a matter
of religion to declare themselves atheists, or else be just as
fruitful a rule for a persecutor as the most complete set of
articles that could be framed by a Spanish Inquisition. For to
'believe' must mean to believe aright &shy; and 'God' must mean
the true God &shy; and 'Christ' the Christ in the sense and with
the attributes understood by Christians who are truly Christians.
An established church with a liturgy is the sufficient solution
of the problem <i>de jure magistratus</i>. Articles of faith are
in this point of view superfluous; for is it not too absurd for a
man to hesitate at subscribing his name to doctrines which yet in
the more awful duty of prayer and profession he dares affirm
before his Maker! They are therefore, in this sense, merely
superfluous; &shy; not worth re-enacting, had they ever been done
away with; &shy; not worth removing now that they exist.<br>
<br>
<b>5.</b>  The characteristic contra-distinction between the
speculative reasoners of the age before the Revolution, and those
since, is this:&shy; the former cultivated metaphysics without,
or neglecting empirical, psychology:&shy; the latter cultivate a
mechanical psychology to the neglect and contempt of metaphysics.
Both, therefore, are almost equi-distant from true philosophy.
Hence the belief in ghosts, witches, sensible replies to prayer,
&amp;c. in Baxter and in a hundred others. See also Luther's <i>Table
Talk</i>.<br>
<br>
<b>6.</b>  The earlier part of this volume is interesting as
materials for medical history. The state of medical science in
the reign of Charles I. was almost incredibly low.</p>

<h2><a name="section55">Fragment of an Essay on Taste</a></h2>

<p>1810.<br>
<br>
The same arguments that decide the question, whether taste has
any fixed principles, may probably lead to a determination of
what those principles are. First then, what is taste in its
metaphorical sense, or, which will be the easiest mode of
arriving at the same solution, what is there in the primary sense
of the word, which may give to its metaphorical meaning an import
different from that of sight or hearing, on the one hand, and of
touch or smell on the other? And this question seems the more
natural, because in correct language we confine beauty, the main
subject of taste, to objects of sight and combinations of sounds,
and never, except sportively or by abuse of words, speak of a
beautiful flavour or a beautiful scent.<br>
<br>
Now the analysis of our senses in the commonest books of
anthropology has drawn our attention to the distinction between
the perfectly organic, and the mixed senses; &shy; the first
presenting objects, as distinct from the perception; &shy; the
last as blending the perception with the sense of the object. Our
eyes and ears &shy; (I am not now considering what is or is not
the case really, but only that of which we are regularly
conscious as appearances,) our eyes most often appear to us
perfect organs of the sentient principle, and wholly in action,
and our hearing so much more so than the three other senses, and
in all the ordinary exertions of that sense, perhaps, equally so
with the sight, that all languages place them in one class, and
express their different modifications by nearly the same
metaphors. The three remaining senses appear in part passive, and
combine with the perception of the outward object a distinct
sense of our own life. Taste, therefore, as opposed to vision and
sound, will teach us to expect in its metaphorical use a certain
reference of any given object to our own being, and not merely a
distinct notion of the object as in itself, or in its independent
properties. From the sense of touch, on the other hand, it is
distinguishable by adding to this reference to our vital being
some degree of enjoyment, or the contrary, &shy; some perceptible
impulse from pleasure or pain to complacency or dislike. The
sense of smell, indeed, might perhaps have furnished a metaphor
of the same import with that of taste; but the latter was
naturally chosen by the majority of civilized nations on account
of the greater frequency, importance, and dignity of its
employment or exertion in human nature.<br>
<br>
By taste, therefore, as applied to the fine arts, we must be
supposed to mean an intellectual perception of any object blended
with a distinct reference to our own sensibility of pain or
pleasure, or, <i>vice versa</i>, a sense of enjoyment or dislike
co-instantaneously combined with, and appearing to proceed from,
some intellectual perception of the object; &shy; intellectual
perception, I say; for otherwise it would be a definition of
taste in its primary rather than in its metaphorical sense.
Briefly, taste is a metaphor taken from one of our mixed senses,
and applied to objects of the more purely organic senses, and of
our moral sense, when we would imply the co-existence of
immediate personal dislike or complacency. In this definition of
taste, therefore, is involved the definition of fine arts,
namely, as being such the chief and discriminative purpose of
which it is to gratify the taste, &shy; that is, not merely to
connect, but to combine and unite, a sense of immediate pleasure
in ourselves, with the perception of external arrangement.<br>
<br>
The great question, therefore, whether taste in any one of the
fine arts has any fixed principle or ideal, will find its
solution in the ascertainment of two facts:&shy; first, whether
in every determination of the taste concerning any work of the
fine arts, the individual does not, with or even against the
approbation of his general judgment, involuntarily claim that all
other minds ought to think and feel the same; whether the common
expressions, 'I dare say I may be wrong, but that is my
particular taste;' &shy; are uttered as an offering of courtesy,
as a sacrifice to the undoubted fact of our individual
fallibility, or are spoken with perfect sincerity, not only of
the reason but of the whole feeling, with the same entireness of
mind and heart, with which we concede a right to every person to
differ from another in his preference of bodily tastes and
flavours. If we should find ourselves compelled to deny this, and
to admit that, notwithstanding the consciousness of our liability
to error, and in spite of all those many individual experiences
which may have strengthened the consciousness, each man does at
the moment so far legislate for all men, as to believe of
necessity that he is either right or wrong, and that if it be
right for him, it is universally right, &shy; we must then
proceed to ascertain:&shy; secondly, whether the source of these
phenomena is at all to be found in those parts of our nature, in
which each intellect is representative of all, &shy; and whether
wholly, or partially. No person of common reflection demands even
in feeling, that what tastes pleasant to him ought to produce the
same effect on all living beings; but every man does and must
expect and demand the universal acquiescence of all intelligent
beings in every conviction of his understanding. ...</p>

<h2><a name="section56">Fragment of an Essay on Beauty</a></h2>

<p>1818.<br>
<br>
The only necessary, but this the absolutely necessary,
pre-requisite to a full insight into the grounds of the beauty in
the objects of sight, is &shy; the directing of the attention to
the action of those thoughts in our own mind which are not
consciously distinguished. Every man may understand this, if he
will but recall the state of his feelings in endeavouring to
recollect a name, which he is quite sure that he remembers,
though he cannot force it back into consciousness. This region of
unconscious thoughts, oftentimes the more working the more
indistinct they are, may, in reference to this subject, be
conceived as forming an ascending scale from the most universal
associations of motion with the functions and passions of life,
&shy; as when, on passing out of a crowded city into the fields
on a day in June, we describe the grass and king-cups as nodding
their heads and dancing in the breeze, &shy; up to the half
perceived, yet not fixable, resemblance of a form to some
particular object of a diverse class, which resemblance we need
only increase but a little, to destroy, or at least injure, its
beauty-enhancing effect, and to make it a fantastic intrusion of
the accidental and the arbitrary, and consequently a disturbance
of the beautiful. This might be abundantly exemplified and
illustrated from the paintings of Salvator Rosa.<br>
<br>
I am now using the term beauty in its most comprehensive sense,
as including expression and artistic interest, &shy; that is, I
consider not only the living balance, but likewise all the
accompaniments that even by disturbing are necessary to the
renewal and continuance of the balance. And in this sense I
proceed to show, that the beautiful in the object may be referred
to two elements, &shy; lines and colours; the first belonging to
the shapely (<i>forma, formalis, formosus</i>), and in this, to
the law, and the reason; and the second, to the lively, the free,
the spontaneous, and the self-justifying. As to lines, the
rectilineal are in themselves the lifeless, the determined <i>ab
extra</i>, but still in immediate union with the cycloidal, which
are expressive of function. The curve line is a modification of
the force from without by the force from within, or the
spontaneous. These are not arbitrary symbols, but the language of
nature, universal and intuitive, by virtue of the law by which
man is impelled to explain visible motions by imaginary causative
powers analogous to his own acts, as the Dryads, Hamadryads,
Naiads, &amp;c.<br>
<br>
The better way of applying these principles will be by a brief
and rapid sketch of the history of the fine arts, &shy; in which
it will be found, that the beautiful in nature has been
appropriated to the works of man, just in proportion as the state
of the mind in the artists themselves approached to the
subjective beauty. Determine what predominance in the minds of
the men is preventive of the living balance of excited faculties,
and you will discover the exact counterpart in the outward
products. Egypt is an illustration of this. Shapeliness is
intellect without freedom; but colours are significant. The
introduction of the arch is not less an epoch in the fine than in
the useful arts.<br>
<br>
Order is beautiful arrangement without any purpose <i>ad
extra</i>; &shy; therefore there is a beauty of order, or order
may be contemplated exclusively as beauty.<br>
<br>
The form given in every empirical intuition, &shy; the stuff,
that is, the quality of the stuff, determines the agreeable: but
when a thing excites us to receive it in such and such a mould,
so that its exact correspondence to that mould is what occupies
the mind, &shy; this is taste or the sense of beauty. Whether
dishes full of painted wood or exquisite viands were laid out on
a table in the same arrangement, would be indifferent to the
taste, as in ladies' patterns; but surely the one is far more
agreeable than the other. Hence observe the disinterestedness of
all taste; and hence also a sensual perfection with intellect is
occasionally possible without moral feeling. So it may be in
music and painting, but not in poetry. How far it is a real
preference of the refined to the gross pleasures, is another
question, upon the supposition that pleasure, in some form or
other, is that alone which determines men to the objects of the
former; &shy; whether experience does not show that if the latter
were equally in our power, occasioned no more trouble to enjoy,
and caused no more exhaustion of the power of enjoying them by
the enjoyment itself, we should in real practice prefer the
grosser pleasure. It is not, therefore, any excellence in the
quality of the refined pleasures themselves, but the advantages
and facilities in the means of enjoying them, that give them the
pre-eminence.<br>
<br>
This is, of course, on the supposition of the absence of all
moral feeling. Suppose its presence, and then there will accrue
an excellence even to the quality of the pleasures themselves;
not only, however, of the refined, but also of the grosser kinds,
&shy; inasmuch as a larger sweep of thoughts will be associated
with each enjoyment, and with each thought will be associated a
number of sensations; and so, consequently, each pleasure will
become more the pleasure of the whole being. This is one of the
earthly rewards of our being what we ought to be, but which would
be annihilated, if we attempted to be it for the sake of this
increased enjoyment. Indeed it is a contradiction to suppose it.
Yet this is the common <i>argumentum in circulo</i>, in which the
eudsemonists flee and pursue. ...</p>

<h3><a name="section58">The French Decade</a></h3>

<p>I have nothing to say in defence of the French revolutionists,
as far as they are personally concerned in this substitution of
every tenth for the seventh day as a day of rest. It was not only
a senseless outrage on an ancient observance, around which a
thousand good and gentle feelings had clustered; it not only
tended to weaken the bond of brotherhood between France and the
other members of Christendom; but it was dishonest, and robbed
the labourer of fifteen days of restorative and humanizing repose
in every year, and extended the wrong to all the friends and
fellow labourers of man in the brute creation. Yet when I hear
Protestants, and even those of the Lutheran persuasion, and
members of the church of England, inveigh against this change as
a blasphemous contempt of the fourth commandment, I pause, and
before I can assent to the verdict of condemnation, I must
prepare my mind to include in the same sentence, at least as far
as theory goes, the names of several among the most revered
reformers of Christianity. Without referring to Luther, I will
begin with Master Frith, a founder and martyr of the church of
England, having witnessed his faith amid the flames in the year
1533. This meek and enlightened, no less than zealous and
orthodox, divine, in his "Declaration of Baptism" thus expresses
himself:<br>
</p>

<blockquote>As for the Sabbath, we be lords of the Sabbath, and
may yet change it into Monday, or any other day, as we see need;
or we may make every tenth day holy day only, if we see cause
why. Neither was there any cause to change it from the Saturday,
save only to put a difference between us and the Jews; neither
need we any holy day at all, if the people might be taught
without it.</blockquote>

<br>
 This great man believed that if Christian nations should ever
become Christians indeed, there would every day be so many hours
taken from the labour for the perishable body, to the service of
the souls and the understandings of mankind, both masters and
servants, as to supersede the necessity of a particular day. At
present our Sunday may be considered as so much Holy Land,
rescued from the sea of oppression and vain luxury, and embanked
against the fury of their billows.<br>

<p>"On a scheme of perfect retribution in the moral world" &shy;
observed Empeiristes, and paused to look at, and wipe his
spectacles.<br>
<br>
"Frogs," interposed Musaello, "must have been experimental
philosophers, and experimental philosophers must all transmigrate
into frogs." "The scheme will not be yet perfect," added Gelon,
"unless our friend Empeiristes, is specially privileged to become
an elect frog twenty times successively, before he reascends into
a galvanic philosopher."<br>
<br>
"Well, well," replied Empeiristes, with a benignant smile, "I
give my consent, if only our little Mary's fits do not
recur."<br>
<br>
Little Mary was Gelon's only child, and the darling and
god-daughter of Empeiristes. By the application of galvanic
influence Empeiristes had removed a nervous affection of her
right leg, accompanied with symptomatic epilepsy. The tear
started in Gelon's eye, and he pressed the hand of his friend,
while Musaello, half suppressing, half indulging, a similar sense
of shame, sportively exclaimed, "Hang it, Gelon! somehow or other
these philosopher fellows always have the better of us wits, in
the long run!"</p>

<p>Our statesmen, who survey with jealous dread all plans for the
education of the lower orders, may be thought to proceed on the
system of antagonist muscles; and in the belief, that the closer
a nation shuts its eyes, the wider it will open its hands. Or do
they act on the principle, that the <i>status belli</i> is the
natural relation between the people and the government, and that
it is prudent to secure the result of the contest by gouging the
adversary in the first instance? Alas! the policy of the maxim is
on a level with its honesty. The Philistines had put out the eyes
of Samson, and thus, as they thought, fitted him to drudge and
grind<br>

<h3><a name="section67">M. Dupuis</a></h3>

<p>Among the extravagancies of faith which have characterized
many infidel writers, who would swallow a whale to avoid
believing that a whale swallowed Jonas, &shy; a high rank should
be given to Dupuis, who, at the commencement of the French
Revolution, published a work in twelve volumes, octavo, in order
to prove that Jesus Christ was the sun, and all Christians,
worshippers of Mithra. His arguments, if arguments they can be
called, consist chiefly of metaphors quoted from the Fathers.
What irresistible conviction would not the following passage from
South's sermons (vol. v. p. 165.) have flashed on his fancy, had
it occurred in the writings of Origen or Tertullian! and how
complete a confutation of all his grounds does not the passage
afford to those humble souls, who, gifted with common sense
alone, can boast of no additional light received through a crack
in their upper apartments:&shy;<br>
</p>

<blockquote>Christ the great sun of righteousness and saviour of
the world, having by a glorious rising, after a red and bloody
setting, proclaimed his deity to men and angels; and by a
complete triumph over the two grand enemies of mankind, sin and
death, set up the everlasting gospel in the room of all false
religions, has now changed the Persian superstition into the
Christian doctrine, and without the least approach to the
idolatry of the former, made it henceforward the duty of all
nations, Jews and Gentiles, to worship the rising
sun.</blockquote>

<br>
 This one passage outblazes the whole host of Dupuis' evidences
and extracts. In the same sermon, the reader will meet with
Hume's argument against miracles anticipated, and put in Thomas's
mouth. <br>

Lactantius. The story would furnish matter for an excellent
pantomime. Hymen was a beautiful youth of Athens, who for the
love of a young virgin disguised himself, and assisted at the
Eleusinian rites: and at this time he, together with his beloved,
and divers other young ladies of that city, was surprized and
carried off by pirates, who supposing him to be what he appeared,
lodged him with his mistress. In the dead of the night when the
robbers were all asleep, he arose and cut their throats. Thence
making hasty way back to Athens, he bargained with the parents
that he would restore to them their daughter and all her
companions, if they would consent to her marriage with him. They
did so, and this marriage proving remarkably happy, it became the
custom to invoke the name of Hymen at all nuptials.</p>

<h3><a name="section69">Egotism</a></h3>

<p>It is hard and uncandid to censure the great reformers in
philosophy and religion for their egotism and boastfulness. It is
scarcely possible for a man to meet with continued personal
abuse, on account of his superior talents, without associating
more and more the sense of the value of his discoveries or
detections with his own person. The necessity of repelling unjust
contempt, forces the most modest man into a feeling of pride and
self-consciousness. How can a tall man help thinking of his size,
when dwarfs are constantly on tiptoe beside him? &shy; Paracelsus
was a braggart and a quack; so was Cardan; but it was their
merits, and not their follies, which drew upon them that torrent
of detraction and calumny, which compelled them so frequently to
think and write concerning themselves,that at length it became a
habit to do so. Wolff too, though not a boaster, was yet
persecuted into a habit of egotism both in his prefaces and in
his ordinary conversation, and the same holds good of the founder
of the Brunonian system, and of his great namesake Giordano
Bruno. The more decorous manners of the present age have attached
a disproportionate opprobrium to this foible, and many therefore
abstain with cautious prudence from all displays of what they
feel. Nay, some do actually flatter themselves, that they abhor
all egotism, and never betray it either in their writings or
discourse. But watch these men narrowly; and in the greater
number of cases you will find their thoughts, feelings, and mode
of expression, saturated with the passion of contempt, which is
the concentrated vinegar of egotism.<br>
<br>
Your very humble men in company, if they produce any thing, are
in that thing of the most exquisite irritability and vanity.<br>
<br>
When a man is attempting to describe another person's character,
he may be right or he may be wrong; but in one thing he will
always succeed, that is, in describing himself. If, for example,
he expresses simple approbation, he praises from a consciousness
of possessing similar qualities; &shy; if he approves with
admiration, it is from a consciousness of deficiency. A. "Ay! he
is a sober man." B. "Ah! Sir, what a blessing is sobriety!" Here
A. is a man conscious of sobriety, who egotizes in <i>tuism</i>;
&shy; B. is one who, feeling the ill effects of a contrary habit,
contemplates sobriety with blameless envy. Again:&shy; A. "Yes,
he is a warm man, a moneyed fellow; you may rely upon him." B.
"Yes, yes, Sir, no wonder! he has the blessing of being well in
the world." This reflection might be introduced in defence of
plaintive egotism, and by way of preface to an examination of all
the charges against it, and from what feelings they proceed.
1800. <a href="#f1o">1</a><br>
<br>
 Contempt is egotism in ill humour. Appetite without moral
affection, social sympathy, and even without passion and
imagination &shy; (in plain English, mere lust,) &shy; is the
basest form of egotism, &shy; and being <i>infra</i> human, or
below humanity, should be pronounced with the harsh breathing, as
<i>he-goat-ism</i>. 1820.<br>

<h3><a name="section70">Cap of Liberty</a></h3>

<p>Those who hoped proudly of human nature, and admitted no

constitution as a colossal statue of Corinthian brass, formed by
the fusion and commixture of all metals in the conflagration of
the state. But there is a common fungus, which so exactly
represents the pole and cap of liberty, that it seems offered by
nature herself as the appropriate emblem of Gallic republicanism,
&shy; mushroom patriots, with a mushroom cap of liberty.</p>

<h3><a name="section71">Bulls</a></h3>

<blockquote><i>Novi ego aliquem qui dormitabundus aliquando
pulsari horam quartam audiverit, et sic numeravit, una, una, una,
una; ac tum pr&aelig; rei absurditate, quam anima concipiebat,
exclamavit, N&aelig;! delirat horologium! Quater pulsavit horam
unam.</i></blockquote>

<br>
 I knew a person, who, during imperfect sleep, or dozing, as we
say, listened to the clock as it was striking four, and as it
struck, he counted the four, one, one, one, one; and then
exclaimed, "Why, the clock is out of its wits; it has struck one
four times over!"<br>
<br>
This is a good exemplification of the nature of <i>Bulls</i>,
which will be found always to contain in them a confusion of what
the schoolmen would have called &shy; objectivity with
subjectivity; &shy; in plain English, the impression of a thing
as it exists in itself, and extrinsically, with the image which
the mind abstracts from the impression. Thus, number, or the
total of a series, is a generalization of the mind, an <i>ens
rationis</i> not an <i>ens reale</i>. I have read many attempts
at a definition of a <i>Bull</i>, and lately in the Edinburgh
Review; but it then appeared to me that the definers had fallen
into the same fault with Miss Edgeworth, in her delightful essay
on <i>Bulls</i>, and given the definition of the genus,
<i>Blunder</i>, for that of the particular species. I will
venture, therefore, to propose the following: a <i>Bull</i>
consists in a mental juxta-position of incongruous images or
thoughts with the sensation, but without the sense, of
connection. The psychological conditions of the possibility of a
<i>Bull</i>, it would not be difficult to determine; but it would
require a larger space than can be afforded here, at least more
attention than my readers would be likely to afford. There is a
sort of spurious <i>Bull</i> which consists wholly in mistake of
language, and which the closest thinker may make, if speaking in
a language of which he is not master.<br>

<h3><a name="section72">Wise Ignorance</a></h3>

<p>It is impossible to become either an eminently great, or truly
pious man, without the courage to remain ignorant of many things.
This important truth is most happily expressed by the elder
Scaliger in prose, and by the younger in verse; the latter
extract has an additional claim from the exquisite terseness of
its diction, and the purity of its Latinity. I particularly
recommend its perusal to the commentators on the Apocalypse.<br>

<h3><a name="section73">Rouge</a></h3>

<p>Triumphant generals in Rome wore rouge. The ladies of France,
and their fair sisters and imitators in Britain, conceive
themselves always in the chair of triumph, and of course entitled
to the same distinction. The custom originated, perhaps, in the
humility of the conquerors that they might seem to blush
continually at their own praises. Mr. Gilpin frequently speaks of
a "picturesque eye:" with something less of solecism, I may
affirm that our fair ever blushing triumphants have secured to
themselves the charm of picturesque cheeks, every face being its
own portrait.</p>

<h3><a name="section75">Motives and Impulses</a></h3>

<p>It is a matter of infinite difficulty, but fortunately of
comparative indifference to determine what a man's motive may
have been for this or that particular action. Rather seek to
learn what his objects in general are. What does he habitually
wish, habitually pursue? and thence deduce his impulses which are
commonly the true efficient causes of men's conduct; and without
which the motive itself would not have become a motive. Let a
haunch of venison represent the motive, and the keen appetite of
health, and exercise the impulse: then place the same or some
more favourite dish before the same man, sick, dyspeptic, and
stomach-worn, and we may then weigh the comparative influences of
motives and impulses. Without the perception of this truth, it is
impossible to understand the character of lago, who is
represented as now assigning one, and then another, and again a
third motive for his conduct, all alike the mere fictions of his
own restless nature, distempered by a keen sense of his
intellectual superiority, and haunted by the love of exerting
power on those especially who are his superiors in practical and
moral excellence. Yet how many among our modern critics have
attributed to the profound author this the appropriate
inconsistency of the character itself.<br>
<br>
A second illustration:&shy; Did Curio, the <i>quondam</i>
patriot, reformer, and semi-revolutionist, abjure his opinion,
and yell the foremost in the hunt of persecution against his old
friends and fellow-philosophists, with a cold clear
predetermination, formed at one moment, of making &pound;5000 a
year by his apostacy? &shy; I neither know nor care. Probably
not. But this I know, that to be thought a man of consequence by
his contemporaries, to be admitted into the society of his
superiors in artificial rank, to excite the admiration of lords,
to live in splendour and sensual luxury, have been the objects of
his habitual wishes. A flash of lightning has turned at once the
polarity of the compass needle: and so, perhaps, now and then,
but as rarely, a violent motive may revolutionize a man's
opinions and professions. But more frequently his honesty dies
away imperceptibly from evening into twilight, and from twilight
into utter darkness. He turns hypocrite so gradually, and by such
tiny atoms of motion, that by the time he has arrived at a given
point, he forgets his own hypocrisy in the imperceptible degrees
of his conversion. The difference between such a man and a bolder
liar, is merely that between the hour hand, and that which tells
the seconds, on a watch. Of the former you can see only the past
motion; of the latter both the past motion and the present
moving. Yet there is, perhaps, more hope of the latter rogue: for
he has lied to mankind only and not to himself &shy; the former
lies to his own heart, as well as to the public.</p>

<h3><a name="section76">Inward Blindness</a></h3>

<p>Talk to a blind man &shy; he knows he wants the sense of
sight, and willingly makes the proper allowances. But there are
certain internal senses, which a man may want, and yet be wholly
ignorant that he wants them. It is most unpleasant to converse
with such persons on subjects of taste, philosophy, or religion.
Of course there is no reasoning with them: for they do not
possess the facts, on which the reasoning must be grounded.
Nothing is possible, but a naked dissent, which implies a sort of
unsocial contempt; or, what a man of kind dispositions is very
likely to fall into, a heartless tacit acquiescence, which
borders too nearly on duplicity.</p>

<h3><a name="section77">The Vices of Slaves No Excuse for
Slavery</a></h3>

<p>It often happens, that the slave himself has neither the power
nor the wish to be free. He is then brutified; but this apathy is
the dire effect of slavery, and so far from being a justifying
cause, that it contains the grounds of its bitterest
condemnation. The Carlovingian race bred up the Merovingi as
beasts; and then assigned their unworthiness as the satisfactory
reason for their dethronement. Alas! the human being is more
easily weaned from the habit of commanding than from that of
abject obedience. The slave loses his soul when he loses his
master; even as the dog that has lost himself in the street,
howls and whines till he has found the house again, where he had
been kicked and cudgelled, and half starved to boot. As we,
however, or our ancestors must have inoculated our
fellow-creature with this wasting disease of the soul, it becomes
our duty to cure him; and though we cannot immediately make him
free, yet we can, and ought to, put him in the way of becoming so
at some future time, if not in his own person, yet in that of his
children. The French, you will say, are not capable of freedom.
Grant this; &shy; but does this fact justify the ungrateful
traitor, whose every measure has been to make them still more
incapable of it?</p>

<h3><a name="section78">Circulation of the Blood</a></h3>

<p>The ancients attributed to the blood the same motion of ascent
and descent which really takes place in the sap of trees.
Servetus discovered the minor circulation from the heart to the
lungs. Do not the following passages of Giordano Bruno (published
in 1591) seem to imply more? I put the question, <i>pauperis
forma</i>, with unfeigned diffidence.<br>
</p>

<blockquote><i>"De Immenso et Innumerabili,"</i> lib. vi. cap.
8:<br>
<br>
 <i>Ut in nostro corpore sanguis per totum circumcursat et
recursat, sic in toto mundo, astro, tellure.<br>
<br>
 Quare non aliter quam nostro in corpore sanguis Hinc meat, hinc
remeat, neque ad inferiora fluit vi Majore, ad supera a pedibus
quam deinde recedat:&shy;</i></blockquote>

<br>
 and still more plainly, in the ninth chapter of the same
book,<br>


<blockquote><i>Quid esset Quodam ni gyro naturae cuncta redirent
Ortus ad proprios rursum; si sorbeat omnes Pontus aquas, totum
non restituatque perenni Ordine; qua possit rerum consistere
vita? Tanquam si totus concurrat sanguis in unam, In qua
consistat, partem, nec prima revisat Ordia, et antiquos cursus
non inde resumat.</i></blockquote>

<br>
 It is affirmed in the <i>Supplement to the Scotch
Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica,</i> that Des Cartes was the first
who in defiance of Aristotle and the Schools, attributed infinity
to the universe. The very title of Bruno's poem proves, that this
honour belongs to him.<br>
<br>
Feyjoo lays claim to a knowledge of the circulation of the blood
for Francisco de la Reyna, a farrier, who published a work upon
his own art at Burgos, in 1564. The passage which he quotes is
perfectly clear.

<blockquote><i>Por manera, que la sangre anda en torno, y en
rueda por todos los miembros, excluye toda duda.</i></blockquote>

Whether Reyna himself claimed any discovery, Feyjoo does not
mention; &shy; but, these words seem to refer to some preceding
demonstration of the fact. I am inclined to think that this, like
many other things, was known before it was discovered; just as
the preventive powers of the vaccine disease, the existence of
adipocire in graves, and certain principles in grammar and in
population, upon which bulky books have been written and great
reputations raised in our days. <br>

<h3><a name="section85">Magnanimity</a></h3>

<p>The following ode was written by Giordano Bruno, under
prospect of that martyrdom which he soon after suffered at Rome,
for atheism: that is, as is proved by all his works, for a lofty
and enlightened piety, which was of course unintelligible to
bigots and dangerous to an apostate hierarchy. If the human mind
be, as it assuredly is, the sublimest object which nature affords
to our contemplation, these lines which portray the human mind
under the action of its most elevated affections, have a fair
claim to the praise of sublimity. The work from which they are

the Nolan philosopher), and I have never seen them

<br>
 The conclusion alludes to a charge of impenetrable obscurity, in
which Bruno shares one and the same fate with Plato, Aristotle,
Kant, and in truth with every great discoverer and benefactor of
the human race; excepting only when the discoveries have been
capable of being rendered palpable to the outward senses, and
have therefore come under the cognizance of our "sober judicious
critics," the men of "sound common sense;" that is, of those
snails in intellect, who wear their eyes at the tips of their
feelers, and cannot even see unless they at the same time touch.
When these finger-philosophers affirm that Plato, Bruno, &amp;c. must
have been "out of their senses," the just and proper retort is,
&shy; "Gentlemen! it is still worse with you! you have lost your
reason!"<br>
<br>
By the by, Addison in the Spectator has grossly misrepresented
the design and tendency of Bruno's <i>Bestia Triomphante</i>; the
object of which was to show of all the theologies and theogonies
which have been conceived for the mere purpose of solving
problems in the material universe, that as they originate in
fancy, so they all end in delusion, and act to the hindrance or
prevention of sound knowledge and actual discovery. But the
principal and most important truth taught in this allegory is,
that in the concerns of morality all pretended knowledge of the
will of Heaven which is not revealed to man through his
conscience; that all commands which do not consist in the
unconditional obedience of the will to the pure reason, without
tampering with consequences (which are in God's power, not in
ours); in short, that all motives of hope and fear from invisible
powers, which are not immediately derived from, and absolutely
coincident with, the reverence due to the supreme reason of the
universe, are all alike dangerous superstitions. The worship
founded on them, whether offered by the Catholic to St. Francis,

<p>There are certain tribes of Negros who take for the deity of

<p>Certain full and highly-wrought dissuasives from sensual
indulgencies, in the works of theologians as well as of satirists
and story-writers, may, not unaptly, remind one of the Pharos;
the many lights of which appeared at a distance as one, and this
as a polar star, so as more often to occasion wrecks than prevent
them.<br>
<br>
At the base of the Pharos the name of the reigning monarch was
engraved, on a composition, which the artist well knew would last
no longer than the king's life. Under this, and cut deep in the
marble itself, was his own name and dedication: "Sostratos of
Gyndos, son of Dexiteles to the Gods, protectors of sailors!"

<h3><a name="section89">Sense and Common Sense</a></h3>

<p>I have noticed two main evils in philosophizing. The first is,
the absurdity of demanding proof for the very facts which
constitute the nature of him who demands it, &shy; a proof for
those primary and unceasing revelations of self-consciousness,
which every possible proof must pre-suppose; reasoning, for
instance, <i>pro</i> and <i>con</i>, concerning the existence of
the power of reasoning. Other truths may be ascertained; but
these are certainty itself (all at least which we mean by the
word), and are the measure of every thing else which we deem
certain. The second evil is, that of mistaking for such facts
mere general prejudices, and those opinions that, having been
habitually taken for granted, are dignified with the name of
common sense. Of these, the first is the more injurious to the
reputation, the latter more detrimental to the progress of
philosophy. In the affairs of common life we very properly appeal
to common sense; but it is absurd to reject the results of the
microscope from the negative testimony of the naked eye. Knives
are sufficient for the table and the market; &shy; but for the
purposes of science we must dissect with the lancet.<br>
<br>
As an instance of the latter evil, take that truly powerful and
active intellect, Sir Thomas Brown, who, though he had written a
large volume in detection of vulgar errors, yet peremptorily
pronounces the motion of the earth round the sun, and
consequently the whole of the Copernican system unworthy of any
serious confutation, as being manifestly repugnant to common
sense; which said common sense, like a miller's scales, used to
weigh gold or gasses, may, and often does, become very gross,
though unfortunately not very uncommon, nonsense. And as for the
former, which may be called <i>Logica Praepostera</i>, I have
read in metaphysical essays of no small fame, arguments drawn
<i>ab extra</i> in proof and disproof of personal identity,
which, ingenious as they may be, were clearly anticipated by the
little old woman's appeal to her little dog, for the solution of
the very same doubts, occasioned by her petticoats having been
cut round about:&shy;<br>

<h3><a name="section90">Toleration</a></h3>

<p>I dare confess that Mr. Locke's treatise on <i>Toleration</i>
appeared to me far from being a full and satisfactory answer to
the subtle and oft-times plausible arguments of Bellarmin, and
other Romanists. On the whole, I was more pleased with the
celebrated W. Penn's tracts on the same subject. The following
extract from his excellent letter to the king of Poland appeals
to the heart rather than to the head, to the Christian rather
than to the philosopher; and, besides, overlooks the ostensible
object of religious penalties, which is not so much to convert
the heretic, as to prevent the spread of heresy. The thoughts,
however, are so just in themselves, and expressed with so much
life and simplicity, that it well deserves a place in these
<i>Omniana</i>:&shy;<br>
</p>

<blockquote>Now, O Prince! give a poor Christian leave to
expostulate with thee. Did Christ Jesus or his holy followers
endeavour, by precept or example, to set up their religion with a
carnal sword? Called he any troops of men or angels to defend
him? Did he encourage Peter to dispute his right with the sword?
But did he not say, <i>Put it up</i>? Or did he countenance his
over-zealous disciples, when they would have had fire from heaven
to destroy those that were not of their mind? No! But did not
Christ rebuke them, saying, <i>Ye know not what spirit ye are
of?</i> And if it was neither Christ's spirit, nor their own
spirit that would have fire from heaven &shy; Oh! what is that
spirit that would kindle fire on earth to destroy such as
peaceably dissent upon the account of conscience!<br>
<br>
 O King! when did the true religion persecute? When did the true
church offer violence for religion? Were not her weapons prayers,
tears, and patience? did not Jesus conquer by these weapons, and
vanquish cruelty by suffering? can clubs, and staves, and swords,
and prisons, and banishments reach the soul, convert the heart,
or convince the understanding of man? When did violence ever make
a true convert, or bodily punishment, a sincere Christian? This
maketh void the end of Christ's coming. Yea, it robbeth God's
spirit of its office, which is to convince the world. That is the
sword by which the ancient Christians overcame.</blockquote>

<br>
 The theory of persecution seems to rest on the following
assumptions. <br>
<b>1.</b>  A duty implies a right. We have a right to do whatever
it is our duty to do.<br>
 <b>2.</b>  It is the duty and consequently the right of the
supreme power in a state to promote the greatest possible sum of
well-being in that state.<br>
<b>3.</b>  This is impossible without morality.<br>
 <b>4.</b>  But morality can neither be produced or preserved in
a people at large without true religion. <br>
<b>5.</b>  Relative to the duties of the legislature or
governors, that is the true religion which they conscientiously
believe to be so.<br>
<b>6.</b>  As there can be but one true religion, at the same
time, this one it is their duty and right to authorize and
protect. <br>
<b>7.</b>  But the established religion cannot be protected and
secured except by the imposition of restraints or the influence
of penalties on those, who profess and propagate hostility to it.
<br>
 <b>8.</b>  True religion, consisting of precepts, counsels,
commandments, doctrines, and historical narratives, cannot be
effectually proved or defended, but by a comprehensive view of
the whole as a system. Now this cannot be hoped for from the mass
of mankind. But it may be attacked, and the faith of ignorant men
subverted by particular objections, by the statement of
difficulties without any counter-statement of the greater
difficulties which would result from the rejection of the former,
and by all the other stratagems used in the desultory warfare of
sectaries and infidels. This is, however, manifestly dishonest
and dangerous, and there must exist, therefore, a power in the
state to prevent, suppress, and punish it. <br>
<b>9.</b>  The advocates of toleration have never been able to
agree among themselves concerning the limits to their own claims;
have never established any clear rules, as to what shall and what
shall not be admitted under the name of religion and conscience.
Treason and the grossest indecencies not only may be, but have
been, called by these names: as among the earlier
Anabaptists.<br>
<b>10.</b>  And last, it is a <i>petitio principii</i>, or
begging the question, to take for granted that a state has no
power except in case of overt acts. It is its duty to prevent a
present evil, as much at least as to punish the perpetrators of
it. Besides, preaching and publishing are overt acts. Nor has it
yet been proved, though often asserted, that a Christian
sovereign has nothing to do with the eternal happiness or misery
of the fellow creatures entrusted to his charge. <br>

<h3><a name="section91">Hint for a New Species of
History</a></h3>

<blockquote>"The very knowledge of the opinions and customs of so
considerable a part of mankind as the Jews now are, and
especially have been heretofore, is valuable both for pleasure
and use. It is a very good piece of history, and that of the best
kind, namely, of human nature, and of that part of it which is
most different from us, and commonly the least known to us. And,
indeed, the principal advantage which is to be made by the wiser
sort of men of most writings, is rather to see what men think and
are, than to be informed of the natures and truth of things; to
observe what thoughts and passions have occupied men's minds,
what opinions and manners they are of. In this view it becomes of
no mean importance to notice and record the strangest ignorance,
the most putid fables, impertinent, trifling, ridiculous
disputes, and more ridiculous pugnacity in the defence and
retention of the subjects disputed." (Publisher's preface to the
reader in Lightfoot's <i>Works</i>, vol. i.)</blockquote>

<br>
 In the thick volume of title pages and chapters of contents
(composed) of large and small works correspondent to each
(proposed) by a certain <i>omni</i>-pregnant,
<i>nihili</i>-parturient genius of my acquaintance, not the least
promising is, &shy; "A History of the morals and (as connected
therewith) of the manners of the English Nation from the Conquest
to the present time." From the chapter of contents it appears,
that my friend is a steady believer in the uninterrupted
progression of his fellow countrymen; that there has been a
constant growth of wealth and well-being among us, and with these
an increase of knowledge, and with increasing knowledge an
increase and diffusion of practical goodness. The degrees of
acceleration, indeed, have been different at different periods.
The moral being has sometimes crawled, sometimes strolled,
sometimes walked, sometimes run; but it has at all times been
moving onward. If in any one point it has gone backward, it has
been only in order to leap forward in some other. The work was to
commence with a numeration table, or catalogue, of those virtues
or qualities which make a man happy in himself, and which conduce
to the happiness of those about him, in a greater or lesser
sphere of agency. The degree and the frequency in which each of
these virtues manifested themselves, in the successive reigns
from William the Conqueror inclusively, were to be illustrated by
apposite quotations from the works of contemporary writers, not
only of historians and chroniclers, but of the poets, romance
writers, and theologians, not omitting the correspondence between
literary men, the laws and regulations, civil and ecclesiastical,
and whatever records the industry of antiquarians has brought to
light in their provincial, municipal, and monastic
histories:&shy; tall tomes and huge! undegenerate sons of Anak,
which look down from a dizzy height on the dwarfish progeny of
contemporary wit, and can find no associates in size at a less
distance than two centuries; and in arranging which the puzzled
librarian must commit an anachronism in order to avoid an
anatopism.<br>
<br>
Such of these illustrations as most amused or impressed me, when
I heard them (for alas! even his very title pages and contents my
friend composes only in air!) I shall probably attempt to
preserve in different parts of these <i>Omniana</i>. At present I
shall cite one article only which I found wafered on a blank leaf
of his memorandum book, superscribed: "Flattering news for
<i>Anno Domini</i> 2000, whenever it shall institute a comparison
between itself and the l7th and l8th centuries." It consists of
an extract, say rather, an exsection from the Kingston Mercantile
Advertiser, from Saturday, August the 15th, to Tuesday, August
18th, 1801. This paper which contained at least twenty more
advertisements of the very same kind, was found by accident among
the wrapping-papers in the trunk of an officer just returned from
the West India station. They stand here exactly as in the
original, from which they are reprinted:&shy; <br>


<blockquote>Kingston, July 30, 1801.<br>
 Ran away, about three weeks ago, from a penn near Halfway Tree,
a negro wench, named Nancy, of the Chamba country, strong made,
an ulcer on her left leg, marked D. C. diamond between. She is
supposed to be harboured by her husband, Dublin, who has the
direction of a wherry working between this town and Port Royal,
and is the property of Mr. Fishley, of that place; the said negro
man having concealed a boy in his wherry before. Half a joe will
be paid to any person apprehending the above described wench, and
delivering to Mr. Archibald M' Lea, East end; and if found
secreted by any person, the law will be put in force.<br>
<br>
 Kingston, August 13, 1801.<br>
 Strayed on Monday evening last, a negro boy of the Moco country,
named Joe, the property of Mr. Thomas Williams, planter, in St.
John's, who had sent him to town under the charge of a negro man,
with a cart for provisions. The said boy is, perhaps, from 15 to
18 years of age, about twelve months in the country, no mark,
speaks little English, but can tell his owner's name; had on a
long Oznaburg frock. It is supposed he might have gone out to
vend some pears and lemon-grass, and have lost himself in the
street. One pistole will be paid to any person apprehending and
bringing him to this office.<br>
<br>
 Kingston, July 1, 1801.<br>
 Forty Shillings Reward.<br>
 Strayed on Friday evening last, (and was seen going up West
Street the following morning), a small bay HORSE, the left ear
lapped, flat rump, much scored from the saddle on his back, and
marked on the near side F. M. with a diamond between. Whoever
will take up the said horse, and deliver him to W. Balantine,
butcher, back of West Street, will receive the above reward.<br>
<br>
 Kingston, July 4, 1801.<br>
 Strayed on Sunday morning last, from the subscriber's house, in
East Street, a bright dun He-Mule, the mane lately cropped, a
large chafe slightly skinned over on the near buttock, and
otherwise chafed from the action of the harness in his recent
breaking. Half a joe will be paid to any person taking up and
bringing this mule to the subscriber's house, or to the Store in
Harbour Street. JOHN WALSH.<br>
<br>
 Kingston, July 2, 1801.<br>
 Ten pounds Reward,<br>
 Ran away<br>
 About two years ago from the subscriber, a Negro woman named<br>
 DORAH,<br>
 purchased from Alexander M'Kean, Esq. She is about 20 years of
age, and 5 feet 6 or 7 inches high; has a mark on one of her
shoulders, about the size of a quarter dollar, occasioned, she
says, by the yaws; of a coal black complexion, very artful, and
most probably passes about the country with false papers and
under another name; if that is not the case, it must be presumed
she is harboured about Green pond, where she has a mother and
other connexions.</blockquote>

<br>
 What a history! horses and negros! negros and horses! It makes
me tremble at my own nature. Surely, every religious and
conscientious Briton is equally a debtor in gratitude to Thomas
Clarkson and his fellow labourers with every African: for on the
soul of every individual among us did a portion of guilt rest, as
long as the Slave Trade remained legal.<br>
<br>
A few years back the public was satiated with accounts of the
happy condition of the slaves in our colonies, and the great
encouragements and facilities afforded to such of them, as by
industry and foresight laboured to better their situation. With
what truth this is stated as the general tone of feeling among
our planters, and their agents, may be conjectured from the
following sentences, which made part of what in England we call
the leading paragraph of the same newspaper:&shy; <br>


<blockquote>Strange as it may appear, we are assured as a fact,
that a number of slaves in this town have purchased lots of land,
and are absolutely in possession of the fee simple of lands and
tenements. Neither is it uncommon for the men slaves to purchase
or manumize their wives, and <i>vice versa</i>, the wives their
husbands. To account for this, we need only look to the
depredations daily committed, and the impositions practised to
the distress of the community and ruin of the fair trader. Negro
yards too, under such direction, will necessarily prove the
asylum of runaways from the country.</blockquote>

<h3><a name="section92">Text Sparring</a></h3>

<p>When I hear (as who now can travel twenty miles in a stage
coach without the probability of hearing) an ignorant religionist
quote an unconnected sentence of half a dozen words from any part
of the Old or New Testament, and resting on the literal sense of
these words the eternal misery of all who reject, nay, even of
all those countless myriads, who have never had the opportunity
of accepting this, and sundry other articles of faith conjured up
by the same textual magic; I ask myself what idea these persons
form of the Bible, that they should use it in a way in which they
themselves use no other book? They deem the whole written by
inspiration. Well! but is the very essence of rational discourse,
that is, connection and dependency done away, because the
discourse is infallibly rational? The mysteries, which these
spiritual lynxes detect in the simplest texts, remind me of the
500 nondescripts, each as large as his own black cat, which Dr.
Katterfelto, by aid of his solar microscope, discovered in a drop
of transparent water.<br>
<br>
But to a contemporary who has not thrown his lot in the same
helmet with them, these fanatics think it a crime to listen. Let
them then, or far rather, let those who are in danger of
infection from them, attend to the golden aphorisms of the old
and orthodox divines. "Sentences in scripture (says Dr. Donne)
like hairs in horses' tails, concur in one root of beauty and
strength; but being plucked out, one by one, serve only for
springes and snares."<br>
<br>
The second I transcribe from the preface to Lightfoot's works.
"Inspired writings are an inestimable treasure to mankind; for so
many sentences, so many truths. But then the true sense of them
must be known: otherwise, so many sentences, so many authorized
falsehoods."</p>

<h3><a name="section93">Pelagianism</a></h3>

<p>Our modern latitudinarians will find it difficult to suppose,
that anything could have been said in the defence of Pelagianism
equally absurd with the facts and arguments which have been
adduced in favour of original sin, (sin being taken as guilt;
that is, observes a Socinian wit, the crime of being born). But
in the comment of Rabbi Akibah on Ecclesiastes xii. 1. we have a
story of a mother, who must have been a most determined believer
in the uninheritability of sin. For having a sickly and deformed
child, and resolved that it should not be thought to have been
punished for any fault of its parents or ancestors, and yet
having nothing else for which to blame the child, she seriously
and earnestly accused it before the judge of having kicked her
unmercifully during her pregnancy.<br>
<br>
I am firmly persuaded that no doctrine was ever widely diffused
among various nations through successive ages and under different
religions, (such as is the doctrine of original sin, and
redemption, those fundamental articles of every known religion
professing to be revealed,) which is not founded either in the
nature of things or in the necessities of our nature. In the
language of the schools, it carries with it presumptive evidence
that it is either objectively or subjectively true. And the more
strange and contradictory such a doctrine may appear to the
understanding, or discursive faculty, the stronger is the
presumption in its favour. For whatever satirists may say, and
sciolists imagine, the human mind has no predilection for
absurdity. I do not, however, mean that such a doctrine shall be
always the best possible representation of the truth on which it
is founded; for the same body casts strangely different shadows
in different places, and different degrees of light, but that it
always does shadow out some such truth, and derive its influence
over our faith from our obscure perception of that truth. Yea,
even where the person himself attributes his belief of it to the
miracles, with which it was announced by the founder of his
religion.</p>

<h2><a name="section94">The Soul and its Organs of Sense</a></h2>

<p>It is a strong presumptive proof against materialism, that
there does not exist a language on earth, from the rudest to the
most refined, in which a materialist can talk for five minutes
together, without involving some contradiction in terms to his
own system. <i>Objection</i>. Will not this apply equally to the
astronomer? Newton, no doubt, talked of the sun's rising and
setting, just like other men. What should we think of the coxcomb
who should have objected to him, that he contradicted his own
system? <i>Answer</i> &shy; No! it does not apply equally; say
rather, it is utterly inapplicable to the astronomer and natural
philosopher. For his philosophic, and his ordinary language speak
of two quite different things, both of which are equally true. In
his ordinary language he refers to a fact of appearance, to a
phenomenon common and necessary to all persons in a given
situation; in his scientific language he determines that one
position or figure, which being supposed, the appearance in
question would be the necessary result, and all appearances in
all situations maybe demonstrably foretold. Let a body be
suspended in the air, and strongly illuminated. What figure is
here? A triangle. But what here? A trapezium; &shy; and so on.
The same question put to twenty men, in twenty different
positions and distances, would receive twenty different answers:
each would be a true answer. <a name="f6qr"></a>But what is that
one figure which, being so placed, all these facts of appearance
must result according to the law of perspective? &shy; Ay! this
is a different question, this is a new subject. The words which
answer this would be absurd if used in reply to the former. <a
href="#f6q">1</a><br>
<br>
Thus, the language of the scripture on natural objects is as
strictly philosophical as that of the Newtonian system. Perhaps
more so. For it is not only equally true, but it is universal
among mankind, and unchangeable. It describes facts of
appearance. And what other language would have been consistent
with the divine wisdom? The inspired writers must have borrowed
their terminology, either from the crude and mistaken philosophy
of their own times, and so have sanctified and perpetuated
falsehood, unintelligible meantime to all but one in ten
thousand; or they must have anticipated the terminology of the
true system, without any revelation of the system itself, and so
have become unintelligible to all men; or lastly, they must have
revealed the system itself, and thus have left nothing for the
exercise, developement, or reward of the human understanding,
instead of teaching that moral knowledge, and enforcing those
social and civic virtues, out of which the arts and sciences will
spring up in due time and of their own accord. But nothing of
this applies to the materialist; he refers to the very same
facts, of which the common language of mankind speaks: and these
too are facts that have their sole and entire being in our own
consciousness; facts, as to which <i>esse</i> and <i>conscire</i>
are identical. Now, whatever is common to all languages, in all
climates, at all times, and in all stages of civilization, must
be the exponent and consequent of the common consciousness of man
as man. Whatever contradicts this universal language, therefore,
contradicts the universal consciousness, and the facts in
question subsisting exclusively in consciousness, whatever
contradicts the consciousness contradicts the fact.<br>
<br>
I have been seduced into a dry discussion where I had intended
only a few amusing facts, in proof, that the mind makes the sense
far more than the senses make the mind. If I have life, and
health, and leisure, I purpose to compile from the works,
memoirs, and transactions of the different philosophical
societies in Europe, from magazines, and the rich store of
medical and psychological publications, furnished by the English,
French, and German press, all the essays and cases that relate to
the human faculties under unusual circumstances, (for pathology
is the crucible of physiology), excluding such only as are not
intelligible without the symbols or terminology of science. <a
name="f7zr"></a>These I would arrange under the different senses
and powers: as</p>

<ul>
<li>the eye,</li>

<li>the ear,</li>

<li>the imitative power, voluntary and automatic;</li>

<li>the imagination, or shaping and modifying power;</li>

<li>the fancy or the aggregative and associative power;</li>

<li>the understanding, or the regulative, substantiating, and
realizing power;</li>

<li>the speculative reason, <i>vis theoretica et scientifica</i>,
or the power, by which we produce, or aim to produce, unity,
necessity, and a universality in all our knowledge by means of
principles, <a href="#f7z">2</a> <i>a priori</i>;</li>

<li>the will or practical reason;</li>

<li>the faculty of choice, (<i>Willk&uuml;hr</i>), and</li>

<li>(distinct both from the moral will, and the choice), the
sensation of volition which I have found reason to include under
the head of single and double touch.</li>
</ul>

<br>
Thence I propose to make a new arrangement of madness, whether as
defect, or as excess, of any of these senses or faculties; and
thus by appropriate cases to shew the difference between; &shy;
<br>
<b>1.</b>  a man having lost his reason but not his senses or
understanding &shy; that is, when he sees things as other men see
them, &shy; adapts means to ends as other men would adapt them,
and not seldom, with more sagacity, &shy; but his final end is
altogether irrational:<br>
 <b>2.</b>  his having lost his wits, that is, his understanding
or judicial power; but not his reason or the use of his senses,
&shy; (such was Don Quixote; and, therefore, we love and
reverence him, while we despise Hudibras): <br>
<b>3.</b>  his being out of his senses, as in the case of a
hypochondriac, to whom his limbs appear to be of glass, although
all his conduct is both rational, or moral, and prudent: <br>
<b>4.</b>  Or the case may be a combination of all three, though
I doubt the existence of such a case, or of any two of them: <br>
<b>5.</b>  And lastly, it may be merely such an excess of
sensation, as overpowers and suspends all, which is frenzy or
raving madness.<br>
<br>
A diseased state of an organ of sense, or of the inner organs
connected with it, will perpetually tamper with the
understanding, and unless there be an energetic and watchful
counter-action of the judgment (of which I have known more than
one instance, in which the comparing and reflecting judgment has
obstinately, though painfully, rejected the full testimony of the
senses,) will finally overpower it. But when the organ is
obliterated, or totally suspended, then the mind applies some
other organ to a double use. Passing through Temple Sowerby, in
Westmorland, some ten years back, I was shewn a man perfectly
blind; and blind from his infancy. Fowell was his name. This
man's chief amusement was fishing on the wild and uneven banks of
the River Eden, and up the different streams and tarns among the
mountains. He had an intimate friend, likewise stone blind, a
dexterous card player, who knows every gate and stile far and
near throughout the country. These two often coursed together,
and the people here, as every where, fond of the marvellous,
affirm that they were the best beaters up of game in the whole
country. The every way amiable and estimable John Gough of Kendal
is not only an excellent mathematician, but an infallible
botanist and zoologist. He has frequently at the first feel
corrected the mistakes of the most experienced sportsman with
regard to the birds or vermin which they had killed, when it
chanced to be a variety or rare species so completely resembling
the common one, that it required great steadiness of observation
to detect the difference, even after it had been pointed out. As
to plants and flowers, the rapidity of his touch appears fully
equal to that of sight; and the accuracy greater. Good heavens!
it needs only to look at him! Why his face sees all over! It is
all one eye! I almost envied him; for the purity and excellence
of his own nature, never broken in upon by those evil looks, (or
features, which are looks become fixtures), with which low
cunning, habitual cupidity, presumptuous sciolism, and
heart-hardening vanity, coarsen the human face, &shy; it is the
mere stamp, the undisturbed <i>ectypon</i> of his own soul! Add
to this that he is a Quaker, with all the blest negatives,
without any of the silly and factious positives, of that sect,
which, with all its bogs and hollows, is still the prime
sun-shine spot of Christendom in the eye of the true philosopher.
When I was in Germany in the year 1798, I read at Hanover, and
met with two respectable persons, one a clergyman, the other a
physician, who confirmed to me, the account of the upper-stall
master at Hanover, written by himself, and countersigned by all
his medical attendants. As far as I recollect, he had fallen from
his horse on his head, and in consequence of the blow lost both
his sight and hearing for nearly three years, and continued for
the greater part of this period in a state of nervous fever. His
understanding, however, remained unimpaired and unaffected, and
his entire consciousness, as to outward impressions, being
confined to the sense of touch, he at length became capable of
reading any book (if printed, as most German books are, on coarse
paper) with his fingers, in much the same manner in which the
<i>piano-forte</i> is played, and latterly with an almost
incredible rapidity. Likewise by placing his hand with the
fingers all extended, at a small distance from the lips of any
person that spoke slowly and distinctly to him, he learned to
recognize each letter by its different effects on his nerves, and
thus spelt the words as they were uttered. It was particularly
noticed both by himself from his sensations, and by his medical
attendants from observation, that the letter R, if pronounced
full and strong, and recurring once or more in the same word,
produced a small spasm, or twitch in his hand and fingers. At the
end of three years he recovered both his health and senses, and
with the necessity soon lost the power, which he had thus
acquired.<br>

<h2><a name="section95">Sir George Etherege, etc.</a></h2>

<p>Often and often had I read Gay's <i>Beggar's Opera</i>, and
always delighted with its poignant wit and original satire, and
if not without noticing its immorality, yet without any offence
from it. Some years ago, I for the first time saw it represented
in one of the London theatres; and such were the horror and
disgust with which it impressed me, so grossly did it outrage all
the best feelings of my nature, that even the angelic voice, and
perfect science of Mrs. Billington, lost half their charms, or
rather increased my aversion to the piece by an additional sense
of incongruity. Then I learned the immense difference between
reading and seeing a play; &shy; and no wonder, indeed; for who
has not passed over with his eye a hundred passages without
offence, which he yet could not have even read aloud, or have
heard so read by another person, without an inward struggle?
&shy; In mere passive silent reading the thoughts remain mere
thoughts, and these too not our own, &shy; phantoms with no
attribute of place, no sense of appropriation, that flit over the
consciousness as shadows over the grass or young corn in an April
day. But even the sound of our own or another's voice takes them
out of that lifeless, twilight, realm of thought, which is the
confine, the <i>intermundium</i>, as it were, of existence and
non-existence. Merely that the thoughts have become audible by
blending with them a sense of outness gives them a sort of
reality. What then, &shy; when by every contrivance of scenery,
appropriate dresses, according and auxiliary looks and gestures,
and the variety of persons on the stage, realities are employed
to carry the imitation of reality as near as possible to perfect
delusion?<br>
<br>
If a manly modesty shrinks from uttering an indecent phrase
before a wife or sister in a private room, what must be the
effect when a repetition of such treasons (for all gross and
libidinous allusions are emphatically treasons against the very
foundations of human society, against all its endearing
charities, and all the mother virtues,) is hazarded before a
mixed multitude in a public theatre? When every innocent woman
must blush at once with pain at the thoughts she rejects, and
with indignant shame at those, which the foul hearts of others
may attribute to her!<br>
<br>
Thus too with regard to the comedies of Wycherly, Vanburgh, and
Etherege, I used to please myself with the flattering comparison
of the manners universal at present among all classes above the
lowest with those of our ancestors even of the highest ranks. But
if for a moment I think of those comedies as having been acted, I
lose all sense of comparison in the shame, that human nature
could at any time have endured such outrages to its dignity; and
if conjugal affection and the sweet name of sister were too weak,
that yet filial piety, the gratitude for a mother's holy love,
should not have risen and hissed into infancy these traitors to
their own natural gifts, who lampooned the noblest passions of
humanity, in order to pander for its lowest appetites.<br>
<br>
As far, however, as one bad thing can be palliated by comparison
with a worse, this may be said, in extenuation of these writers;
that the mischief, which they can do even on the stage, is
trifling compared with that stile of writing which began in the
pest-house of French literature, and has of late been imported by
the <i>Littles</i> of the age, which consists in a perpetual
tampering with the morals without offending the decencies. And
yet the admirers of these publications, nay, the authors
themselves have the assurance to complain of Shakspeare (for I
will not refer to one yet far deeper blasphemy) &shy; Shakspeare,
whose most objectionable passages are but grossnesses against
lust, and these written in a gross age; while three fourths of
their whole works are delicacies for its support and sustenance.
Lastly, that I may leave the reader in better humour with the
name at the head of this article, I shall quote one scene from
Etherege's <i>Love in a Tub</i>, which for exquisite, genuine,
original humour, is worth all the rest of his plays, though two
or three of his witty contemporaries were thrown in among them,
as a make weight. The scene might be entitled, the different ways
in which the very same story may be told without any variation in
matter of fact; for the least attentive reader will perceive the
perfect identity of the footboy's account with the Frenchman's
own statement in contradiction to it.<br>

<h2><a name="section96">Evidence</a></h2>

<p>When I was at Malta, 1805, there happened a drunken squabble
on the road from Valette to St. Antonio, between a party of
soldiers and another of sailors. They were brought before me the
next morning, and the great effect which their intoxication had
produced on their memory, and the little or no effect on their
courage in giving evidence, may be seen by the following
specimen. The soldiers swore that the sailors were the first
aggressors, and had assaulted them with the following words: "
&shy; your eyes! who stops the line of march there?" The sailors
with equal vehemence and unanimity averred, that the soldiers
were the first aggressors, and had burst in on them calling out
&shy; "Heave to, you lubbers! or we'll run you down."</p>

<h2><a name="section101">Brevity of the Greek and English
Compared</a></h2>

<p>As an instance of compression and brevity in narration,
unattainable in any language but the Greek, the following distich
was quoted:<br>
<br>
 <img src="images/ColLitRemGk27.gif" width="413" height="56" align=
"left" alt=
"[Greek (transliterated): Chruson anaer euron, helipe brochon autar o chruson, hon lipen, ouk ehuron, haephen, hon ehure, brochon.]">
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
 This was denied by one of the company, who instantly rendered
the lines in English, contending with reason that the indefinite
article in English, together with the pronoun "his," &amp;c. should
be considered as one word with the noun following, and more than
counterbalanced by the greater number of syllables in the Greek
words, the terminations of which are in truth only little words
glued on to them. The English distich follows, and the reader
will recollect that it is a mere trial of comparative brevity,
wit and poetry quite out of the question:<br>

<h2><a name="section125">Rationalism is not Reason</a></h2>

<p><i>Vengeance is mine, saith the Lord</i>. An awful text! Now
because vengeance is most wisely and lovingly forbidden to us,
hence we have by degrees, under false generalizations and puny
sensibilities, taken up the notion that vengeance is no where. In
short, the abuse of figurative interpretation is endless; &shy;
instead of being applied, as it ought to be, to those things
which are the most comprehensible, that is, sensuous, and which
therefore are the parts likely to be figurative, because such
language is a condescension to our weakness, &shy; it is applied
to rot away the very pillars, yea, to fret away and dissolve the
very corner stones of the temple of religion. O, holy Paul! O,
beloved John! full of light and love, whose books are full of
intuitions, as those of Paul are books of energies, &shy; the one
uttering to sympathizing angels what the other toils to convey to
weak-sighted yet docile men:&shy; O Luther! Calvin! Fox, with
Penn and Barclay! O Zinzendorf! and ye too, whose outward
garments only have been singed and dishonoured in the heathenish
furnace of Roman apostacy, Francis of Sales, Fenelon; &shy; yea,

ye were alive with your merely human perfections, listen to the

They, who in the very outset deny all reason, and leave us
nothing but degrees to distinguish us from brutes; &shy; a
greater degree of memory, dearly purchased by the greater
solicitudes of fear which convert that memory into foresight. O!
place before your eyes the island of Britain in the reign of
Alfred, its unpierced woods, its wide morasses and dreary heaths,
its blood-stained and desolated shores, its untaught and scanty
population; behold the monarch listening now to Bede, and now to
John Erigena; and then see the same realm, a mighty empire, full
of motion, full of books, where the cotter's son, twelve years
old, has read more than archbishops of yore, and possesses the
opportunity of reading more than our Alfred himself; &shy; and

<h2><a name="section128">Self-Love in Religion</a></h2>

<p>The unselfishness of self-love in the hopes and fears of
religion consists; &shy; first, &shy; in the previous necessity
of a moral energy, in order so far to subjugate the sensual,
which is indeed and properly the selfish, part of our nature, as
to believe in a state after death, on the grounds of the
Christian religion:&shy; secondly, &shy; in the abstract and, as
it were, unindividual nature of the idea, self, or soul, when
conceived apart from our present living body and the world of the
senses. In my religious meditations of hope and fear, the
reflection that this course of action will purchase heaven for
me, for my soul, involves a thought of and for all men who pursue
the same course. In worldly blessings, such as those promised in
the Old Law, each man might make up to himself his own favourite
scheme of happiness. "I will be strictly just, and observe all
the laws and ceremonies of my religion, that God may grant me
such a woman for my wife, or wealth and honour, with which I will
purchase such and such an estate," &amp;c. But the reward of heaven
admits no day-dreams; its hopes and its fears are too vast to
endure an outline. "I will endeavour to abstain from vice, and
force myself to do such and such acts of duty, in order that I
may make myself capable of that freedom of moral being, without
which heaven would be no heaven to me." Now this very thought
tends to annihilate self. For what is a self not distinguished
from any other self, but like an individual circle in geometry,
uncoloured, and the representative of all other circles. The
circle is differenced, indeed, from a triangle or square; so is a
virtuous soul from a vicious soul, a soul in bliss from a soul in
misery, but no wise distinguished from other souls under the same
predicament. That selfishness which includes, of necessity, the
selves of all my fellow-creatures, is assuredly a social and
generous principle. I speak, as before observed, of the objective
or reflex self; &shy; for as to the subjective self, it is merely
synonymous with consciousness, and obtains equally whether I
think of me or of him; &shy; in both cases it is I thinking.<br>
<br>
Still, however, I freely admit that there neither is, nor can be,
any such self-oblivion in these hopes and fears when practically
reflected on, as often takes place in love and acts of loving
kindness, and the habit of which constitutes a sweet and loving
nature. And this leads me to the third, and most important
reflection, namely, that the soul's infinite capacity of pain and
of joy, through an infinite duration, does really, on the most
high-flying notions of love and justice, make my own soul and the
most anxious care for the character of its future fate, an object
of emphatic duty. What can be the object of human virtue but the
happiness of sentient, still more of moral, beings? But an
infinite duration of faculties, infinite in progression, even of
one soul, is so vast, so boundless an idea, that we are unable to
distinguish it from the idea of the whole race of mankind. If to
seek the temporal welfare of all mankind be disinterested virtue,
much more must the eternal welfare of my own soul be so; &shy;
for the temporal welfare of all mankind is included within a
finite space and finite number, and my imagination makes it easy
by sympathies and visions of outward resemblance; but myself in
eternity, as the object of my contemplation, differs unimaginably
from my present self. Do but try to think of yourself in eternal
misery! &shy; you will find that you are stricken with horror for
it, even as for a third person; conceive it in hazard thereof,
and you will feel commiseration for it, and pray for it with an
anguish of sympathy very different from the outcry of an
immediate self-suffering.<br>
<br>
Blessed be God! that which makes us capable of vicious
self-interestedness, capacitates us also for disinterestedness.
That I am capable of preferring a smaller advantage of my own to
a far greater good of another man, &shy; this, the power of
comparing the notions of "him and me" objectively, enables me
likewise to prefer &shy; at least furnishes the condition of my
preferring &shy; a greater good of another to a lesser good of my
own; &shy; nay, a pleasure of his, or external advantage, to an
equal one of my own. And thus too, that I am capable of loving my
neighbour as myself, empowers me to love myself as my neighbour,
&shy; not only as much, but in the same way and with the very
same feeling.<br>
<br>
This is the great privilege of pure religion. By diverting
self-love to our self under those relations, in which alone it is
worthy of our anxiety, it annihilates self, as a notion of
diversity. Extremes meet. These reflections supply a forcible,
and, I believe, quite new argument against the purgatory, both of
the Romanists, and of the modern Millennarians, and final
Salvationists. Their motives do, indeed, destroy the essence of
virtue.<br>
<br>
The doctors of self-love are misled by a wrong use of the words,
&shy; "We love ourselves!" Now this is impossible for a finite
and created being in the absolute meaning of self; and in its
secondary and figurative meaning, self signifies only a less
degree of distance, a narrowness of moral view, and a
determination of value by measurement. Hence the body is in this
sense our self, because the sensations have been habitually
appropriated to it in too great a proportion; but this is not a
necessity of our nature. There is a state possible even in this
life, in which we may truly say, "My self loves," &shy; freely
constituting its secondary or objective love in what it wills to
love, commands what it wills, and wills what it commands. The
difference between self-love, and self that loves, consists in
the objects of the former as given to it according to the law of
the senses, while the latter determines the objects according to
the law in the spirit. The first loves because it must; the
second, because it ought; and the result of the first is not in
any objective, imaginable, comprehensible, action, but in that
action by which it abandoned its power of true agency, and willed
its own fall. This is, indeed, a mystery. How can it be
otherwise? &shy; For if the will be unconditional, it must be
inexplicable, the understanding of a thing being an insight into
its conditions and causes. But whatever is in the will is the
will, and must therefore be equally inexplicable.<br>
<br>
In a word, the difference of an unselfish from a selfish love,
even in this life, consists in this, that the latter depends on
our transferring our present passion or appetite, or rather on
our dilating and stretching it out in imagination, as the
covetous man does; &shy; while in the former we carry ourselves
forward under a very different state from the present, as the
young man, who restrains his appetites in respect of his future
self as a tranquil and healthy old man. This last requires as
great an effort of disinterestedness as, if not a greater than,
to give up a present enjoyment to another person who is present
to us. The alienation from distance in time and from diversity of
circumstance, is greater in the one case than in the other. And
let it be remembered, that a Christian may exert all the virtues
and virtuous charities of humanity in any state; yea, in the
pangs of a wounded conscience, he may feel for the future periods
of his own lost spirit, just as Adam for all his posterity.<br>

jeweller may devote his whole time to jewels unblamed; but the

to excite and gratify it, or the mere repetition of a daydream;
&shy; or if it be granted that love has a real, distinct, and
excellent being, I know not how we could attach blame and
immorality to inconstancy, when confined to the affections and a

this mutual transfusion can take place more perfectly and totally
in this, than in any other mode.<br>
<br>
Prefer person before money, good-temper with good sense before
person; and let all, wealth, easy temper, strong understanding
and beauty, be as nothing to thee, unless accompanied by virtue
in principle and in habit.<br>

Suppose competence, health, and honesty; then a happy marriage

<p>The small number of surnames, and those Christian names and

Scotland the Mackintoshes, Macaulays, and so on. But the most

<h2><a name="section145">German Language</a></h2>

<p>The real value of melody in a language is considerable as
subadditive; but when not jutting out into consciousness under
the friction of comparison, the absence or inferiority of it is,
as privative of pleasure, of little consequence. For example,
when I read Voss's translation of the <i>Georgics</i>, I am, as
it were, reading the original poem, until something particularly
well expressed occasions me to revert to the Latin; and then I
find the superiority, or at least the powers, of the German in
all other respects, but am made feelingly alive, at the same
time, to its unsmooth mixture of the vocal and the organic, the
fluid and the substance, of language. The fluid seems to have
been poured in on the corpuscles all at once, and the whole has,
therefore, curdled, and collected itself into a lumpy soup full
of knots of curds inisled by interjacent whey at irregular
distances, and the curd lumpets of various sizes.<br>
<br>
It is always a question how far the apparent defects of a
language arise from itself or from the false taste of the nation
speaking it. Is the practical inferiority of the English to the
Italian in the power of passing from grave to light subjects, in
the manner of <i>Ariosto</i>, the fault of the language itself?
Wieland in his <i>Oberon</i>, broke successfully through equal
difficulties. It is grievous to think how much less careful the
English have been to preserve than to acquire. Why have we lost,
or all but lost, the <i>ver</i> or <i>for</i> as a prefix, &shy;
<i>fordone</i>, <i>forwearied</i>, &amp;c.; and the <i>zer</i> or
<i>to</i>,-<i>zerreissen</i>, to rend, &amp;c. <i>Jugend</i>,
<i>J&uuml;ngling</i>: <i>youth</i>, <i>youngling</i>; why is that
last word now lost to common use, and confined to sheep and other
animals?</p>

The different meanings attached to the same word or phrase in
different sentences, will, of course, be accompanied with a
different feeling in the mind; this will affect the
pronunciation, and hence arises a new word. We should vainly try

<h2><a name="section148">an Admonition</a></h2>

<br>
<p>There are two sides to every question. If thou hast genius and
poverty to thy lot, dwell on the foolish, perplexing, imprudent,
dangerous, and even immoral, conduct of promise-breach in small
things, of want of punctuality, of procrastination in all its
shapes and disguises. Force men to reverence the dignity of thy
moral strength in and for itself, &shy; seeking no excuses or
palliations from fortune, or sickness, or a too full mind that,
in opulence of conception, overrated its powers of application.
But if thy fate should be different, shouldest thou possess
competence, health and ease of mind, and then be thyself called
upon to judge such faults in another so gifted, &shy; O! then,
upon the other view of the question, say, Am I in ease and
comfort, and dare I wonder that he, poor fellow, acted so and so?
Dare I accuse him? Ought I not to shadow forth to myself that,
glad and luxuriating in a short escape from anxiety, his mind
over-promised for itself; that, want combating with his eager
desire to produce things worthy of fame, he dreamed of the
nobler, when he should have been producing the meaner, and so had
the meaner obtruded on his moral being, when the nobler was
making full way on his intellectual? Think of the manifoldness of
his accumulated petty calls! Think, in short, on all that should
be like a voice from heaven to warn thyself against this and
this, and call it all up for pity and for palliation; and then
draw the balance. Take him in his whole, &shy; his head, his
heart, his wishes, his innocence of all selfish crime, and a
hundred years hence, what will be the result? The good, &shy;
were it but a single volume that made truth more visible, and
goodness more lovely, and pleasure at once more akin to virtue
and, self-doubled, more pleasurable! and the evil, &shy; while he

grave. Follow it not thither.</p>

<h2><a name="section150">Definition of Miracle</a></h2>

<p>A phaenomenon in no connection with any other phaenomenon, as
its immediate cause, is a miracle; and what is believed to have
been such, is miraculous for the person so believing When it is
strange and surprising, that is, with out any analogy in our
former experience &shy; it is called a miracle. The kind defines
the thing:&shy; the circumstances the word.<br>
<br>
To stretch out my arm is a miracle, unless the materialists
should be more cunning than they have proved themselves hitherto.
To reanimate a dead man by an act of the will, no intermediate
agency employed, not only is, but is called, a miracle. A
scripture miracle, therefore, must be so defined, as to express,
not only its miracular essence, but likewise the condition of its
appearing miraculous; add therefore to the preceding, the words
<i>praeter omnem prior em experientiam</i>.<br>
<br>
It might be defined likewise an effect, not having its cause in
any thing congenerous. That thought calls up thought is no more
miraculous than that a billiard ball moves a billiard ball; but
that a billiard ball should excite a thought, that is, be
perceived, is a miracle, and, were it strange, would be called
such. For take the converse, that a thought should call up a
billiard ball! Yet where is the difference, but that the one is a
common experience, the other never yet experienced?<br>
<br>
It is not strictly accurate to affirm, that every thing would
appear a miracle, if we were wholly uninfluenced by custom, and
saw things as they are:&shy; for then the very ground of all
miracles would probably vanish, namely, the heterogeneity of
spirit and matter. For the <i>quid ulterius?</i> of wonder, we
should have the <i>ne plus ultra</i> of adoration.<br>
<br>
Again &shy; the word miracle has an objective, a subjective, and
a popular meaning; &shy; as objective, &shy; the essence of a
miracle consists in the heterogeneity of the consequent and its
causative antecedent; &shy; as subjective, &shy; in the
assumption of the heterogeneity. Add the wonder and surprise
excited, when the consequent is out of the course of experience,
and we know the popular sense and ordinary use of the word.</p>

<h2><a name="section151">Death, and Grounds for Belief in a
Future State</a></h2>

<p>It is an important thought, that death, judged of by corporeal
analogies, certainly implies discerption or dissolution of parts;
but pain and pleasure do not; nay, they seem inconceivable except
under the idea of concentration. Therefore the influence of the
body on the soul will not prove the common destiny of both. I
feel myself not the slave of nature (nature used here as the
<i>mundus sensibilis</i>) in the sense in which animals are. Not
only my thoughts and affections extend to objects trans-natural,
as truth, virtue, God; not only do my powers extend vastly beyond
all those, which I could have derived from the instruments and
organs, with which nature has furnished me; but I can do what
nature <i>per se</i> cannot. I ingraft, I raise heavy bodies
above the clouds, and guide my course over ocean and through air.
I alone am lord of fire and light; other creatures are but their
alms-folk, and of all the so called elements, water, earth, air,
and all their compounds (to speak in the ever-enduring language
of the senses, to which nothing can be revealed, but as compact,
or fluid, or aerial), I not merely subserve myself of them, but I
employ them. <i>Ergo</i>, there is in me, or rather I am, a
pr&aelig;ter-natural, that is, a super-sensuous thing: but what
is not nature, why should it perish with nature? why lose the
faculty of vision, because my spectacles are broken?<br>
<br>
Now to this it will be objected, and very forcibly too; &shy;
that the soul or self is acted upon by nature through the body,
and water or caloric, diffused through or collected in the brain,
will derange the faculties of the soul by deranging the
organization of the brain; the sword cannot touch the soul; but
by rending the flesh, it will rend the feelings. Therefore the
violence of nature may, in destroying the body, mediately destroy
the soul! It is to this objection that my first sentence applies;
and is an important, and, I believe, a new and the only
satisfactory reply I have ever heard.<br>
<br>
The one great and binding ground of the belief of God and a
hereafter, is the law of conscience: but as the aptitudes, and
beauty, and grandeur, of the world, are a sweet and beneficent
inducement to this belief, a constant fuel to our faith, so here
we seek these arguments, not as dissatisfied with the one main
ground, not as of <i>little faith</i>, but because, believing it
to be, it is natural we should expect to find traces of it, and
as a noble way of employing and developing, and enlarging the
faculties of the soul, and this, not by way of motive, but of
assimilation, producing virtue.<br>

<h2><a name="section152">Hatred of Injustice</a></h2>

<p>It is the mark of a noble nature to be more shocked with the
unjust condemnation of a bad man than of a virtuous one; as in
the instance of Strafford. For in such cases the love of justice,
and the hatred of the contrary, are felt more nakedly, and
constitute a strong passion <i>per se</i>, not only unaided by,
but in conquest of, the softer self-repaying sympathies. A wise
foresight too inspires jealousy, that so may principles be most
easily overthrown. This is the virtue of a wise man, which a mob
never possesses, even as a mob never, perhaps, has the malignant
<i>finis ultimus</i>, which is the vice of a man.</p>

<h2><a name="section153">Religion</a></h2>

<p>Amongst the great truths are these:&shy;<br>
<br>
<b>I.</b>  That religion has no speculative dogmas; that all is
practical, all appealing to the will, and therefore all
imperative. <i>I am the Lord thy God: Thou shall have none other
gods but me.</i><br>
<br>
<b>II.</b>  That, therefore, miracles are not the proofs, but the
necessary results, of revelation. They are not the key of the
arch and roof of evidence, though they may be a compacting stone
in it, which gives while it receives strength. Hence, to make the
intellectual faith a fair analogon or unison of the vital faith,
it ought to be stamped in the mind by all the evidences duly
co-ordinated, and not designed by single pen-strokes, beginning
either here or there.<br>
<br>
<b>III.</b>  That, according to No. I., Christ is not described
primarily and characteristically as a teacher, but as a doer; a
light indeed, but an effective light, the sun which causes what
it shows, as well as shows what it first causes.<br>
<br>
<b>IV.</b>  That a certain degree of morality is presupposed in
the reception of Christianity; it is the <i>substratum</i> of the
moral interest which substantiates the evidence of miracles. The
instance of a profligate suddenly converted, if properly sifted,
will be found but an apparent exception.<br>
<br>
<b>V.</b>  That the being of a God, and the immortality of man,
are every where assumed by Christ.<br>
<br>
<b>VI.</b>  That Socinianism is not a religion, but a theory, and
that, too, a very pernicious, or a very unsatisfactory, theory.
Pernicious, &shy; for it excludes all our deep and awful ideas of
the perfect holiness of God, his justice and his mercy, and
thereby makes the voice of conscience a delusion, as having no
correspondent in the character of the legislator; regarding God
as merely a good-natured pleasure-giver, so happiness be
produced, indifferent as to the means:&shy; Unsatisfactory, for
it promises forgiveness without any solution of the difficulty of
the compatibility of this with the justice of God; in no way
explains the fallen condition of man, nor offers any means for
his regeneration. "If you will be good, you will be happy," it
says: that may be, but my will is weak; I sink in the
struggle.<br>
<br>
<b>VII.</b>  That Socinianism never did and never can subsist as
a general religion. For<br>
</p>

<blockquote>1. It neither states the disease, on account of which
the human being hungers for revelation, nor prepares any remedy
in general, nor ministers any hope to the individual.<br>
<br>
2. In order to make itself endurable on scriptural grounds, it
must so weaken the texts and authority of scripture, as to leave
in scripture no binding ground of proof of any thing.<br>
<br>
3. Take a pious Jew, one of the Maccabees, and compare his faith
and its grounds with Priestley's; and then, for what did Christ
come?</blockquote>

<br>
 <b>VIII.</b>  That Socinianism involves the shocking thought
that man will not, and ought not to be expected to, do his duty
as man, unless he first makes a bargain with his Maker, and his
Maker with him. Give me, the individual me, a positive proof that
I shall be in a state of pleasure after my death, if I do so and
so, and then I will do it, not else! And the proof asked is not
one dependent on, or flowing from, his moral nature and moral
feelings, but wholly <i>extra</i>-moral, namely, by his outward
senses, the subjugation of which to faith, that is, the passive
to the actional and self-created belief, is the great object of
all religion!<br>
<br>
<b>IX.</b>  That Socinianism involves the dreadful reflection,
that it can establish its probability (its certainty being wholly
out of the question and impossible, Priestley himself declaring
that his own continuance as a Christian depended on a
contingency,) only on the destruction of all the arguments
furnished for our permanent and essential distinction from
brutes; that it must prove that we have no grounds to obey, but,
on the contrary, that in wisdom we ought to reject and declare
utterly null, all the commands of conscience, and all that is
implied in those commands, reckless of the confusion introduced
into our notions of means and ends by the denial of truth,
goodness, justice, mercy, and the other fundamental ideas in the
idea of God; and all this in order to conduct us to a Mahomet's
bridge of a knife's edge, or the breadth of a spear, to
salvation. And, should we discover any new documents, or should
an acuter logician make plain the sophistry of the deductions
drawn from the present documents (and surely a man who has passed
from orthodoxy to the loosest Arminianism, and thence to
Arianism, and thence to direct Humanism, has no right from his
experience to deny the probability of this) &shy; then to fall
off into the hopeless abyss of atheism. For the present life, we
know, is governed by fixed laws, which the atheist acknowledges
as well as the theist; and if there be no spiritual world, and no
spiritual life in a spiritual world, what possible bearing can
the admission or rejection of this hypothesis have on our
practice or feelings?<br>
<br>
<b>Lastly</b>, the Mosaic dispensation was a scheme of national
education; the Christian is a world-religion; and the former was
susceptible of evidence and probabilities which do not, and
cannot, apply to the latter. A savage people forced, as it were,
into a school of circumstances, and gradually in the course of
generations taught the unity of God, first and for centuries
merely as a practical abstinence from the worship of any other,
&shy; how can the principles of such a system apply to
Christianity, which goes into all nations and to all men, the
most enlightened, even by preference?<br>
<br>
Writing several years later than the date of the preceding
paragraphs, I commend the modern Unitarians for their candour in
giving up the possible worshipability of Christ, if not very God,
&shy; a proof that truth will ultimately prevail. The Arians,
then existing, against whom Waterland wrote, were not converted;
but in the next generation the arguments made their way. This is
fame <i>versus</i> reputation. <br>

<h2><a name="section154">The Apostles' Creed</a></h2>

<p>Is it not probable from what is found in the writings of
Cyril, Eusebius, Cyprian, Marcellus of Ancyra and others, that
our present Apostles' Creed is not the very <i>Symbolum
Fidei</i>, which was not to be written, but was always repeated
at baptism? For this latter certainly contained the doctrine of
the eternal generation of the <i>Logos</i>; and, therefore, it
seems likely that the present Apostles' creed was an
introductory, and, as it were, alphabetical, creed for young
catechumens in their first elementation. Is it to be believed
that the <i>Symbolum Fidei</i> contained nothing but the mere
history of Jesus, without any of the peculiar doctrines, or that,
if it did not contain something more, the great and vehement
defenders of the Trinity would speak of it so magnificently as
they do, even preferring its authority to that of the scriptures?
&shy; Besides, does not Austin positively say that our present
Apostles' creed was gathered out of the scriptures? Whereas the
<i>Symbolum Fidei</i> was elder than the Gospels, and probably
contained only the three doctrines of the Trinity, the
Redemption, and the Unity of the Church. May it not have
happened, when baptism was administered so early, and at last
even to infants, that the old <i>Symbolum Fidei</i> became
gradually <i>inusitatum</i>, as being appropriated to adult
proselytes from Judaism or Paganism? This seems to me even more
than probable; for in proportion to the majority of born over
converted Christians must the creed of instruction have been more
frequent than that of doctrinal profession.</p>

<h2><a name="section155">a Good Heart</a></h2>

<p>There is in Abbt's <i>Essays</i> an attempt to determine the
true sense of this phrase, at least to unfold
(<i>auseinandersetzen</i>) what is meant and felt by it. I was
much pleased with the remarks, I remember, and with the
counterposition of Tom Jones and Sir Charles Grandisori. Might
not Luther and Calvin serve? But it is made less noticeable in
these last by its co-existence with, and sometimes real, more
often apparent, subordination to fixed conscious principles, and
is thus less naturally characteristic. Parson Adams contrasted
with Dr. Harrison in Fielding's <i>Amelia</i> would do. Then
there is the suppression of the good heart and the substitution
of principles or motives for the good heart, as in Laud, and the
whole race of conscientious persecutors. Such principles
constitute the virtues of the Inquisition. A good heart contrasts
with the Pharisaic righteousness. This last contemplation of the
Pharisees, the dogmatists, and the rigorists <i>in toto
genere</i>, serves to reconcile me to the fewness of the men who
act on fixed principles. For unless there exist intellectual
power to determine aright what are the <i>principia jam fixa et
formata</i>, and unless there be the wisdom of love preceding the
love of wisdom, and unless to this be added a graciousness of
nature, a loving kindness, &shy; these rigorists are but bigots
often to errors, and active, yea, remorseless in preventing or
staying the rise and progress of truth. And even when bigotted
adherents to true principles, yet they render truth unamiable,
and forbid little children to come thereunto. As human nature now
is, it is well, perhaps, that the number should be few, seeing
that of the few, the greater part are pre-maturities.<br>
<br>
The number of those who act from good hearted impulses, a kindly
and cheerful mood, and the play of minute sympathies, continuous
in their discontinuity, like the sand-thread of the hour-glass,
and from their minuteness and transiency not calculated to
stiffen or inflate the individual, and thus remaining
unendangered by egotism, and its unhandsome vizard contempt, is
far larger: and though these temperamental <i>pro</i>-virtues
will too often fail, and are not built to stand the storms of
strong temptation; yet on the whole they carry on the benignant
scheme of social nature, like the other instincts that rule the
animal creation. But of all the most numerous are the men, who
have ever more their own dearliest beloved self, as the only or
main goal or butt of their endeavours straight and steady before
their eyes, and whose whole inner world turns on the great axis
of self-interest. These form the majority, if not of mankind, yet
of those by whom the business of life is carried on; and most
expedient it is, that so it should be; nor can we imagine any
thing better contrived for the advantage of society. For these
are the most industrious, orderly, and circumspect portion of
society, and the actions governed by this principle with the
results, are the only materials on which either the statesman, or
individuals can safely calculate.<br>
<br>
There is, indeed, another sort, (a class they can scarcely be
called), who are below self-interest; who live under the mastery
of their senses and appetites; and whose selfishness is an animal
instinct, a goad <i>a tergo</i>, not an attraction, <i>a re
prospecta</i>, or (so to speak) from a projected self. In fact,
such individuals cannot so properly be said to have a self, as to
be machines for the self of nature: and are as little capable of
loving themselves as of loving their neighbours. Such there are.
Nay, (if we were to count only without weighing) the aggregate of
such persons might possibly form a larger number than the class
preceding. But they may safely be taken up into the latter, for
the main ends of society, as being or sure to become its
materials and tools. Their folly is the stuff in which the sound
sense of the worldly-wise is at once manifested and remunerated;
their idleness of thought, with the passions, appetites, likings
and fancies, which are its natural growth, though weeds, give
direction and employment to the industry of the other. The
accidents of inheritance by birth, of accumulation of property in
partial masses, are thus counteracted, &shy; and the aneurisms in
the circulating system prevented or rendered fewer and less
obstinate, &shy; whilst animal want, the sure general result of
idleness and its accompanying vices, tames at length the selfish
host, into the laborious slaves and mechanic implements of the
self-interested. Thus, without public spirit, nay, by the
predominance of the opposite quality, the latter are the public
benefactors: and, giving steadfastness and compactness to the
whole, lay in the ground of the canvass, on which minds of finer
texture may impress beauty and harmony.<br>
<br>
Lastly, there is in the heart of all men a working principle,
&shy; call it ambition, or vanity, or desire of distinction, the
inseparable adjunct of our individuality and personal nature, and
flowing from the same source as language &shy; the instinct and
necessity in each man of declaring his particular existence, and
thus of singling or singularizing himself. In some this principle
is far stronger than in others, while in others its comparative
dimness may pass for its non-existence. But in thoughts at least,
and secret fancies there is in all men (idiocy of course
excepted) a wish to remain the same and yet to be something else,
and something more, or to exhibit what they are, or imagine they
might be, somewhere else and to other spectators. Now, though
this desire of distinction, when it is disproportionate to the
powers and qualities by which the individual is indeed
distinguished, or when it is the governing passion, or taken as
the rule of conduct, is but a "knavish sprite," yet as an
attendant and subaltern spirit, it has its good purposes and
beneficial effects: and is not seldom<br>
</p>

<blockquote>&shy; sent with broom before, To sweep the dust
behind the door.</blockquote>

<br>
 Though selfish in its origin, it yet tends to elevate the
individual from selfishness into self-love, under a softer and
perhaps better form than that of self-interest, the form of
self-respect. Whatever other objects the man may be pursuing, and
with whatever other inclinations, he is still by this principle
impelled and almost compelled to pass out of himself in
imagination, and to survey himself at a sufficient distance, in
order to judge what figure he is likely to make in the eyes of
his fellow men. But in thus taking his station as at the apex of
a triangle, while the self is at one angle of the base, he makes
it possible at least that the image of his neighbour may appear
at the other, whether by spontaneous association, or placed there
for the purposes of comparison; and so both be contemplated at
equal distance. But this is the first step towards
disinterestedness; and though it should never be reached, the
advantage of the appearance is soon learnt, and the necessity of
avoiding the appearance of the contrary. But appearances cannot
be long sustained without some touch of the reality. At all
events there results a control over our actions; some good may be
produced, and many a poisonous or offensive fruit will be
prevented. Courtesy, urbanity, gallantry, munificence; the
outward influence of the law shall I call it, or rather fashion
of honour &shy; these are the handsome hypocrisies that spring
from the desire of distinction. I ask not the genius of a
Machiavel, a Tacitus, or a Swift; &shy; it needs only a worldly
experience and an observing mind, to convince a man of forty that
there is no medium between the creed of misanthropy and that of
the gospel.<br>
<br>
A pagan might be as orthodox as Paul on the doctrine of works.
First, &shy; set aside the large portion of them that have their
source in the constitutional temperament, &shy; the merit of
which, if any, belongs to nature, not to the individual agent;
and of the remaining number of good works, nine are derived from
vices for one that has its origin in virtue. I have often in
looking at the water-works, and complex machinery of our
manufactories, indulged a humorous mood by fancying that the
hammers, cogs, fly-wheels, &amp;c. were each actuated by some
appetite, or passion &shy; hate, rage, revenge, vanity, cupidity,
&amp;c. while the general result was most benignant, and the machine,
taken as a whole, the product of power, knowledge, and
benevolence! Such a machine does the moral world, the world of
human nature, appear &shy; and to those who seem ever more to
place the comparison and the alternative between hell and earth,
and quite overlook the opposition between earth and heaven, I
recommend this meditation. <br>

<a name="f1ur"></a>Evidences of Christianity
<a href="#f1u">1</a></h2>

<p><b>I.</b>  MIRACLES &shy; as precluding the contrary evidence
of no miracles.<br>
<br>
<b>II.</b>  The material of Christianity, its existence and
history.<br>
<br>
<b>III.</b>  The doctrines of Christianity, and the
correspondence of human nature to those doctrines, &shy;
illustrated,<br>
</p>

<blockquote><b>1st,</b>  historically &shy; as the actual
production of a new world, and the dependence of the fate of the
planet upon it; &shy;<br>
<br>
<b>2nd,</b>  individually &shy; from its appeal for its truth to
an asserted fact, &shy; which, whether it be real or not, every
man possessing reason has an equal power of ascertaining within
himself; &shy; namely, a will which has more or less lost its
freedom, though not the consciousness that it ought to be and may
become free; &shy; the conviction that this cannot be achieved
without the operation of a principle connatural with itself;
&shy; the evident rationality of an entire confidence in that
principle, being the condition and means of its operation; &shy;
the experience in his own nature of the truth of the process
described by Scripture as far as he can place himself within the
process, aided by the confident assurances of others as to the
effects experienced by them, and which he is striving to arrive
at. All these form a practical Christian. Add, however, a gradual
opening out of the intellect to more and more clear perceptions
of the strict coincidence of the doctrines of Christianity, with
the truths evolved by the mind, from reflections on its own
nature. To such a man one main test of the objectivity, the
entity, the objective truth of his faith, is its accompaniment by
an increase of insight into the moral beauty and necessity of the
process which it comprises, and the dependence of that proof on
the causes asserted. Believe, and if thy belief be right, that
insight which gradually transmutes faith into knowledge will be
the reward of that belief. The Christian, to whom, after a long
profession of Christianity, the mysteries remain as much
mysteries as before, is in the same state as a schoolboy with
regard to his arithmetic to whom the _facit_ at the end of the
examples in his cyphering book is the whole ground for his
assuming that such and such figures amount to so and so.<br>
<br>
<b>3rd.</b>  In the above I include the increasing discoveries in
the correspondence of the history, the doctrines and the promises
of Christianity, with the past, present, and probable future of
human nature; and in this state a fair comparison of the religion
as a divine philosophy, with all other religions which have
pretended to revelations and all other systems of philosophy;
both with regard to the totality of its truth and its
identification with the manifest march of affairs.</blockquote>

<br>
 I should conclude that, if we suppose a man to have convinced
himself that not only the doctrines of Christianity, which may be
conceived independently of history or time, as the Trinity,
spiritual influences, &amp;c. are coincident with the truths which
his reason, thus strengthened, has evolved from its own sources,
but that the historical dogmas, namely, of the incarnation of the
creative Logos, and his becoming a personal agent, are themselves
founded in philosophical necessity; then it seems irrational,
that such a man should reject the belief of the actual appearance
of a religion strictly correspondent therewith, at a given time
recorded, even as much as that he should reject Caesar's account
of his wars in Gaul, after he has convinced himself <i>a
priori</i> of their probability.<br>
<br>
As the result of these convictions he will not scruple to receive
the particular miracles recorded, inasmuch as it would be
miraculous that an incarnate God should not work what must to
mere men appear as miracles; inasmuch as it is strictly accordant
with the ends and benevolent nature of such a being, to commence
the elevation of man above his mere senses by attracting and
enforcing attention, first through an appeal to those senses. But
with equal reason will he expect that no other or greater force
should be laid on these miracles as such; that they should not be
spoken of as good in themselves, much less as the adequate and
ultimate proof of that religion; and likewise he will receive
additional satisfaction, should he find these miracles so
wrought, and on such occasions, as to give them a personal value
as symbols of important truths when their miraculousness was no
longer needful or efficacious.<br>

<h2><a name="section157"><i>Confessio Fidei</i></a></h2>

<p>Nov. 3, 1816.<br>
<br>
<b>I.</b>  I believe that I am a free-agent, inasmuch as, and so
far as, I have a will, which renders me justly responsible for my
actions, omissive as well as commissive. Likewise that I possess
reason, or a law of right and wrong, which, uniting with my sense
of moral responsibility, constitutes the voice of conscience.<br>
<br>
<b>II.</b>  Hence it becomes my absolute duty to believe, and I
do believe, that there is a God, that is, a Being, in whom
supreme reason and a most holy will are one with an infinite
power; and that all holy will is coincident with the will of God,
and therefore secure in its ultimate consequences by His
omnipotence; &shy; having, if such similitude be not unlawful,
such a relation to the goodness of the Almighty, as a perfect
time-piece will have to the sun.</p>

<blockquote><b>Corollary</b>.<br>
The wonderful works of God in the sensible world are a perpetual
discourse, reminding me of his existence, and shadowing out to me
his perfections. But as all language presupposes in the
intelligent hearer or reader those primary notions, which it
symbolizes; as well as the power of making those combinations of
these primary notions, which it represents and excites us to
combine, &shy; even so I believe, that the notion of God is
essential to the human mind; that it is called forth into
distinct consciousness principally by the conscience, and
auxiliarly by the manifest adaptation of means to ends in the
outward creation. It is, therefore, evident to my reason, that
the existence of God is absolutely and necessarily insusceptible
of a scientific demonstration, and that Scripture has so
represented it. For it commands us to believe in one God. <i>I am
the Lord thy God: thou shalt have none other gods but me</i>. Now
all commandment necessarily relates to the will; whereas all
scientific demonstration is independent of the will, and is
apodictic or demonstrative only as far as it is compulsory on the
mind, <i>volentem, nolentem</i></blockquote>

<br>
 <b>III.</b>  My conscience forbids me to propose to myself the
pains and pleasures of this life, as the primary motive, or
ultimate end, of my actions; &shy; on the contrary, it makes me
perceive an utter disproportionateness and heterogeneity between
the acts of the spirit, as virtue and vice, and the things of the
sense, such as all earthly rewards and punishments must be. Its
hopes and fears, therefore, refer me to a different and spiritual
state of being: and I believe in the life to come, not through
arguments acquired by my understanding or discursive faculty, but
chiefly and effectively, because so to believe is my duty, and in
obedience to the commands of my conscience. Here ends the first
table of my creed, which would have been my creed, had I been
born with Adam; and which, therefore, constitutes what may in
this sense be called natural religion, that is, the religion of
all finite rational beings. The second table contains the creed
of revealed religion, my belief as a Christian.<br>
<br>
<b>IV.</b>  I believe, and hold it as the fundamental article of
Christianity, that I am a fallen creature; that I am of myself
capable of moral evil, but not of myself capable of moral good,
and that an evil ground existed in my will, previously to any
given act, or assignable moment of time, in my consciousness. I
am born a child of wrath. This fearful mystery I pretend not to
understand. I cannot even conceive the possibility of it, &shy;
but I know that it is so. My conscience, the sole fountain of
certainty, commands me to believe it, and would itself be a
contradiction, were it not so &shy; and what is real must be
possible.<br>
<br>
<b>V.</b>  I receive with full and grateful faith the assurance
of revelation, that the Word, which is from all eternity with
God, and is God, assumed our human nature in order to redeem me,
and all mankind from this our connate corruption. My reason
convinces me, that no other mode of redemption is conceivable,
and, as did Socrates, would have yearned after the Redeemer,
though it would not dare expect so wonderful an act of divine
love, except only as an effort of my mind to conceive the utmost
of the infinite greatness of that love.<br>
<br>
<b>VI.</b>  I believe, that this assumption of humanity by the
Son of God, was revealed and realized to vis by the Word made
flesh, and manifested to us in Christ Jesus; and that his
miraculous birth, his agony, his crucifixion, death,
resurrection, and ascension, were all both symbols of our
redemption

<img src="images/ColLitRemGk31.gif" width="146" height="33" alt="[Greek (transliterated): phainomena ton noumenon]">
<img alt="ColLitRemGk32.gif" src="images/ColLitRemGk32.gif" width="104" height="33"> and necessary parts of the awful process.<br>
<br>
<b>VII.</b>  I believe in the descent and sending of the Holy
Spirit, by whose free grace obtained for me by the merits of my
Redeemer, I can alone be sanctified and restored from my natural
inheritance of sin and condemnation, be a child of God, and an
inheritor of the kingdom of God.

<blockquote><b>Corollary</b>.<br>
<br>
The Trinity of persons in the Unity of the God would have been a
necessary idea of my speculative reason, deduced from the
necessary postulate of an intelligent creator, whose ideas being
anterior to the things, must be more actual than those things,
even as those things are more actual than our images derived from
them; and who, as intelligent, must have had co-eternally an
adequate idea of himself, in and through which he created all
things both in heaven and earth. But this would only have been a
speculative idea, like those of circles and other mathematical
figures, to which we are not authorized by the practical reason
to attribute reality. Solely in consequence of our Redemption
does the Trinity become a doctrine, the belief of which as real
is commanded by our conscience. But to Christians it is
commanded, and it is false candour in a Christian, believing in
original sin and redemption therefrom, to admit that any man
denying the divinity of Christ can be a Christian. The true
language of a Christian, which reconciles humility with truth
would be; &shy; God and not man is the judge of man: which of the
two is the Christian, he will determine; but this is evident,
that if the theanthropist is a Christian, the psilanthropist
cannot be so; and <i>vice versa</i>. Suppose, that two tribes
used the same written characters, but attached different and
opposite meanings to them, so that <i>niger</i>, for instance,
was used by one tribe to convey the notion <i>black</i>, by the
other, <i>white</i>; &shy; could they, without absurdity, be said
to have the same language? Even so, in the instance of the
crucifixion, the same image is present to the theanthropist and
to the psilanthropist or Socinian &shy; but to the latter it
represents a mere man, a good man indeed and divinely inspired,
but still a mere man, even as Moses or Paul, dying in attestation
of the truth of his preaching, and in order by his resurrection
to give a proof of his mission, and inclusively of the
resurrection of all men:&shy; to the former it represents God
incarnate taking upon himself the sins of the world, and himself
thereby redeeming us, and giving us life everlasting, not merely
teaching it. The same difference, that exists between God and
man, between giving and the declaration of a gift, exists between
the Trinitarian and the Unitarian. This might be proved in a few
moments, if we would only conceive a Greek or Roman, to whom two
persons relate their belief, each calling Christ by a different
name. It would be impossible for the Greek even to guess, that
they both meant the same person, or referred to the same
facts.</blockquote>

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
